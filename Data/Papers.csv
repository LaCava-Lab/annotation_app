To better understand the antitumor effects of anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibody treatment, we analyzed the effect of CTLA-4 signaling on CD8(+) T cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, cross-linking of CTLA-4 on purified CD8(+) T cells caused decreased proliferative responses to anti-CD3 stimulation and rapid loss of activation marker expression. In vivo, blockade of CTLA-4 by neutralizing anti-CTLA-4 mAb greatly enhanced the accumulation, activation, and cytotoxic activity of CD8(+) T cells induced by immunization with Ag on dendritic cells (DC). This enhanced response did not require the expression of MHC class II molecules on DC or the presence of CD4(+) T cells. These results demonstrate that CTLA-4 blockade is able to directly enhance the proliferation and activation of specific CD8(+) T cells, indicating its potential for tumor immunotherapy even in situations in which CD4(+) T cell help is limited or absent."
9817207,PMC7095117,10.1038/23974,Structure of the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein of influenza C virus.,"Rosenthal PB, Zhang X, Formanowski F, Fitz W, Wong CH, Meier-Ewert H, Skehel JJ, Wiley DC",1998,Nature,396,6706,92-6,"The spike glycoproteins of the lipid-enveloped orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses have three functions: to recognize the receptor on the cell surface, to mediate viral fusion with the cell membrane, and to destroy the receptor. In influenza C virus, a single glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, possesses all three functions. In influenza A and B, the first two activities are mediated by haemagglutinin and the third by a second glycoprotein, neuraminidase. Here we report the crystal structure of the HEF envelope glycoprotein of influenza C virus. We have identified the receptor-binding site and the receptor-destroying enzyme (9-O-acetylesterase) sites, by using receptor analogues. The receptor-binding domain is structurally similar to the sialic acid-binding domain of influenza A haemagglutinin, but binds 9-O-acetylsialic acid. The esterase domain has a structure similar to the esterase from Streptomyces scabies and a brain acetylhydrolase. The receptor domain is inserted into a surface loop of the esterase domain and the esterase domain is inserted into a surface loop of the stem. The stem domain is similar to that of influenza A haemagglutinin, except that the triple-stranded, alpha-helical bundle diverges at both of its ends, and the amino terminus of HEF2, the fusion peptide, is partially exposed. The segregation of HEF's three functions into structurally distinct domains suggests that the entire stem region, including sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of HEF1 which precede the post-translational cleavage site between HEF1 and HEF2, forms an independent fusion domain which is probably derived from an ancestral membrane fusion protein."

We have analyzed the permeability properties of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear envelope (NE) using import (NLS) and export (NES) signal-containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. Compared with wild-type, passive export rates of a classical karyopherin/importin (Kap) Kap60p/Kap95p-targeted NLS-GFP reporter (cNLS-GFP) were significantly faster in nup188-Delta and nup170-Delta cells. Similar results were obtained using two other NLS-GFP reporters, containing either the Kap104p-targeted Nab2p NLS (rgNLS) or the Kap121p-targeted Pho4p NLS (pNLS). Elevated levels of Hsp70 stimulated cNLS-GFP import, but had no effect on the import of rgNLS-GFP. Thus, the role of Hsp70 in NLS-directed import may be NLS- or targeting pathway-specific. Equilibrium sieving limits for the diffusion channel were assessed in vivo using NES-GFP reporters of 36-126 kD and were found to be greater than wild-type in nup188-Delta and nup170-Delta cells. We propose that Nup170p and Nup188p are involved in establishing the functional resting diameter of the NPC's central transport channel."
3491082,PMC2114629,10.1083/jcb.103.6.2421,Integrin (the CSAT antigen): functionality requires oligomeric integrity.,"Buck CA, Shea E, Duggan K, Horwitz AF",1986,J Cell Biol,103,6 Pt 1,2421-8,"Integrin, the cell-substrate attachment (CSAT) antigen, is a complex of integral membrane glycoproteins whose apparent function is to mediate cell-substratum adhesion by serving as a transmembrane link between the extracellular matrix and elements of the cytoskeleton. Previous attempts to separate the members of this complex under nondenaturing conditions have been successful. We have now produced a monoclonal antibody ""G"" that is specific for the lower molecular mass cysteine-rich band 3 of the complex. Using an antibody affinity column containing this monoclonal antibody, it is possible to dissociate integrin into two fractions, one containing band 3, the other containing bands 1 plus 2. Neither fraction will by itself bind fibronectin, laminin, or talin. However, when the fractions are combined, the reconstituted integrin elutes from a gel filtration column in the same position as the native complex, and binding activity to these molecules returns. Further, it is shown by gel filtration that the recognition site for the adhesion-disrupting monoclonal antibodies CSAT and JG22 is on band 3, supporting the contention that integrin is an oligomer. The data presented here is consistent with integrin being either a mixture of heterodimers, each with a common subunit and reacting with a particular extracellular matrix molecule, or a single heterotrimer capable of binding to several different extracellular matrix molecules."
11266456,PMC2199621,10.1083/jcb.152.2.411,Gradient of increasing affinity of importin beta for nucleoporins along the pathway of nuclear import.,"Ben-Efraim I, Gerace L",2001,J Cell Biol,152,2,411-7,"Nuclear import and export signals on macromolecules mediate directional, receptor-driven transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) by a process that is suggested to involve the sequential binding of transport complexes to different nucleoporins. The directionality of transport appears to be partly determined by the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of components of the Ran GTPase system. We have analyzed whether the asymmetric localization of discrete nucleoporins can also contribute to transport directionality. To this end, we have used quantitative solid phase binding analysis to determine the affinity of an importin beta cargo complex for Nup358, the Nup62 complex, and Nup153, which are in the cytoplasmic, central, and nucleoplasmic regions of the NPC, respectively. These nucleoporins are proposed to provide progressively more distal binding sites for importin beta during import. Our results indicate that the importin beta transport complex binds to nucleoporins with progressively increasing affinity as the complex moves from Nup358 to the Nup62 complex and to Nup153. Antibody inhibition studies support the possibility that importin beta moves from Nup358 to Nup153 via the Nup62 complex during import. These results indicate that nucleoporins themselves, as well as the nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization of the Ran system, are likely to play an important role in conferring directionality to nuclear protein import."

The causality between inflammatory cytokines and PTSD risk remains unclear.Methods: We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from 41 inflammatory cytokines and PTSD. Additional analyses included differential gene expression, protein-protein interaction, and functional enrichment to explore underlying mechanisms.Results: MR analysis indicated that higher levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) are associated with a reduced risk of PTSD. Genes POGZ and LRIG2 were identified as mediators, implicated in the TGF-beta signalling pathway.Conclusion: Our findings suggest a protective role of certain cytokines against PTSD and highlight potential molecular mediators. This knowledge could inform future therapeutic strategies for PTSD."

We aimed to design and validate a machine learning (ML) model to predict major postoperative complications or readmission following rTSA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed California's Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database for patients who underwent rTSA between 2015 and 2017. We implemented logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), gradient boosting machines, adaptive boosting, and random forest classifiers in Python and trained these models using 64 binary, continuous, and discrete variables to predict the occurrence of at least one major postoperative complication or readmission following primary rTSA. Models were validated using the standard metrics of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and Brier scores. The key factors for the top-performing model were determined.
RESULTS: Of 2799 rTSAs performed during the study period, 152 patients (5%) had at least 1 major postoperative complication or 30-day readmission. XGBoost had the highest AUROC and AUPRC of 0.681 and 0.129, respectively. The key predictive features in this model were patients with a history of implant complications, protein-calorie malnutrition, and a higher number of comorbidities.
CONCLUSION: Our study reports an ML model for the prediction of major complications or 30-day readmission following rTSA. XGBoost outperformed traditional LR models and also identified key predictive features of complications and readmission."

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) can differentiate into adipocytes. All-trans retinoic acid (atRA, the active form of vitamin A) inhibits the adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs through its receptor RARG. The expression level of FRA1 (FOS like 1, AP-1 transcription factor subunit) in atRA-treated BMSCs increased, suggesting that atRA-mediated inhibition of BMSCs adipogenesis involves FRA1. BMSCs were transfected with adenovirus overexpressing Fra1 (ad-fra1) or silenced for Fra1 (si-fra1) and then treated with atRA. BMSCs treated with atRA and treated with ad-fra1 showed decreased mRNA and protein levels of key adipogenic genes (Pparg2, Cebpa) and adipogenesis-associated genes (Cd36, Fabp, Lpl, and Plin); atRA had a stronger inhibitory effect on adipogenesis compared with that in the ad-fra1 group. Adipogenic gene expression in Fra1-silenced BMSCs was significantly upregulated. Compared with that in the atRA group, the si-fra1 + atRA also upregulated adipogenic gene expression. However, compared with si-fra1, si-fra1 + atRA significantly inhibited adipogenic differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that RARG directly regulates Fra1 and FRA1 directly regulates Pparg2 and Cebpa. The results supported the conclusion that atRA inhibits BMSC adipogenesis partially through the RARG-FRA1-PPARG2 or the CEBPA axis or both. Thus, vitamin A might be used to treat obesity and its related diseases."
18927618,PMC2562983,10.1371/journal.pone.0003447,PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of p107 plays a critical role in chondrocyte cell cycle arrest by FGF.,"Kolupaeva V, Laplantine E, Basilico C",2008,PLoS One,3,10,e3447,"FGF signaling inhibits chondrocyte proliferation, a cell type-specific response that is the basis for several genetic skeletal disorders caused by activating FGFR mutations. This phenomenon requires the function of the p107 and p130 members of the Rb protein family, and p107 dephosphorylation is one of the earliest distinguishing events in FGF-induced growth arrest. To determine whether p107 dephoshorylation played a critical role in the chondrocyte response to FGF, we sought to counteract this process by overexpressing in RCS chondrocytes the cyclin D1/cdk4 kinase complex. CyclinD/cdk4-expressing RCS cells became resistant to FGF-induced p107 dephosphorylation and growth arrest, and maintained significantly high levels of cyclin E/cdk2 activity and of phosphorylated p130 at later times of FGF treatment. We explored the involvement of a phosphatase in p107 dephosphorylation. Expression of the SV40 small T-Ag, which inhibits the activity of the PP2A phosphatase, or knockdown of the expression of the PP2A catalytic subunit by RNA interference prevented p107 dephosphorylation and FGF-induced growth arrest of RCS cells. Furthermore, an association between p107 and PP2A was induced by FGF treatment. Our data show that p107 dephosphorylation is a key event in FGF-induced cell cycle arrest and indicate that in chondrocytes FGF activates the PP2A phosphatase to promote p107 dephosphorylation."
22253573,PMC3254663,10.1371/journal.pbio.1001238,USP8 promotes smoothened signaling by preventing its ubiquitination and changing its subcellular localization.,"Xia R, Jia H, Fan J, Liu Y, Jia J",2012,PLoS Biol,10,1,e1001238,"The seven transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) is a critical component of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway and is regulated by phosphorylation, dimerization, and cell-surface accumulation upon Hh stimulation. However, it is not clear how Hh regulates Smo accumulation on the cell surface or how Hh regulates the intracellular trafficking of Smo. In addition, little is known about whether ubiquitination is involved in Smo regulation. In this study, we demonstrate that Smo is multi-monoubiquitinated and that Smo ubiquitination is inhibited by Hh and by phosphorylation. Using an in vivo RNAi screen, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8) as a deubiquitinase that down-regulates Smo ubiquitination. Inactivation of USP8 increases Smo ubiquitination and attenuates Hh-induced Smo accumulation, leading to decreased Hh signaling activity. Moreover, overexpression of USP8 prevents Smo ubiquitination and elevates Smo accumulation, leading to increased Hh signaling activity. Mechanistically, we show that Hh promotes the interaction of USP8 with Smo aa625-753, which covers the three PKA and CK1 phosphorylation clusters. Finally, USP8 promotes the accumulation of Smo at the cell surface and prevents localization to the early endosomes, presumably by deubiquitinating Smo. Our studies identify USP8 as a positive regulator in Hh signaling by down-regulating Smo ubiquitination and thereby mediating Smo intracellular trafficking."
23873214,PMC3752380,10.1038/nchembio.1298,A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.,"Lofgren M, Padovani D, Koutmos M, Banerjee R",2013,Nat Chem Biol,9,9,535-9,"Fidelity during cofactor assembly is essential for the proper functioning of metalloenzymes and is ensured by specific chaperones. MeaB, a G-protein chaperone for the coenzyme B12-dependent radical enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), uses the energy of GTP binding, hydrolysis or both to regulate cofactor loading into MCM, protect MCM from inactivation and rescue MCM that is inactivated during turnover. Typically, G proteins signal to client proteins using the conformationally mobile switch I and II loops. Crystallographic snapshots of MeaB reported herein reveal a new switch III element that has substantial conformational plasticity. Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the switch III motif is critical for bidirectional signal transmission of the GTPase-activating protein activity of MCM and the chaperone functions of MeaB in the MeaB-MCM complex. Mutations in the switch III loop identified in patients corrupt this interprotein communication and lead to methylmalonic aciduria, an inborn error of metabolism."

To identify cellular factors that interact with NS2 and are important for HCV propagation, we screened a human liver cDNA library by split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length NS2 as a bait, and identified signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (SPCS1), which is a component of the microsomal signal peptidase complex. Silencing of endogenous SPCS1 resulted in markedly reduced production of infectious HCV, whereas neither processing of structural proteins, cell entry, RNA replication, nor release of virus from the cells was impaired. Propagation of Japanese encephalitis virus was not affected by knockdown of SPCS1, suggesting that SPCS1 does not widely modulate the viral lifecycles of the Flaviviridae family. SPCS1 was found to interact with both NS2 and E2. A complex of NS2, E2, and SPCS1 was formed in cells as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Knockdown of SPCS1 impaired interaction of NS2 with E2. Our findings suggest that SPCS1 plays a key role in the formation of the membrane-associated NS2-E2 complex via its interaction with NS2 and E2, which leads to a coordinating interaction between the structural and non-structural proteins and facilitates the early step of assembly of infectious particles."

Spidroins are highly repetitive in sequence but capped by nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains (NT and CT) that are suggested to regulate fiber conversion in similar manners. By using ion selective microelectrodes we found that the pH gradient in the silk gland is much broader than previously known. Surprisingly, the terminal domains respond in opposite ways when pH is decreased from 7 to 5: Urea denaturation and temperature stability assays show that NT dimers get significantly stabilized and then lock the spidroins into multimers, whereas CT on the other hand is destabilized and unfolds into ThT-positive β-sheet amyloid fibrils, which can trigger fiber formation. There is a high carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2) in distal parts of the gland, and a CO2 analogue interacts with buried regions in CT as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Activity staining of histological sections and inhibition experiments reveal that the pH gradient is created by carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase activity emerges in the same region of the gland as the opposite effects on NT and CT stability occur. These synchronous events suggest a novel CO2 and proton-dependent lock and trigger mechanism of spider silk formation."

These complex networks of stable and transient associations can be mapped by affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and complementary proximity-based labeling methods such as BioID. To exploit the advantages of both strategies, we here design and optimize an integrated approach combining AP-MS and BioID in a single construct, which we term MAC-tag. We systematically apply the MAC-tag approach to 18 subcellular and 3 sub-organelle localization markers, generating a molecular context database, which can be used to define a protein's molecular location. In addition, we show that combining the AP-MS and BioID results makes it possible to obtain interaction distances within a protein complex. Taken together, our integrated strategy enables the comprehensive mapping of the physical and functional interactions of proteins, defining their molecular context and improving our understanding of the cellular interactome."

TPCs belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily and are ubiquitously expressed in animals and plants. Mammalian TPC1 and TPC2 are localized at the endolysosomal membrane, and have critical roles in regulating the physiological functions of these acidic organelles. Here we present electron cryo-microscopy structures of mouse TPC1 (MmTPC1)-a voltage-dependent, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-activated Na+-selective channel-in both the apo closed state and ligand-bound open state. Combined with functional analysis, these structures provide comprehensive structural insights into the selectivity and gating mechanisms of mammalian TPC channels. The channel has a coin-slot-shaped ion pathway in the filter that defines the selectivity of mammalian TPCs. Only the voltage-sensing domain from the second 6-TM domain confers voltage dependence on MmTPC1. Endolysosome-specific PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> binds to the first 6-TM domain and activates the channel under conditions of depolarizing membrane potential. Structural comparisons between the apo and PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-bound structures show the interplay between voltage and ligand in channel activation. These MmTPC1 structures reveal lipid binding and regulation in a 6-TM voltage-gated channel, which is of interest in light of the emerging recognition of the importance of phosphoinositide regulation of ion channels."

Crystal structures of Group B Streptococcus GAPDH in the apo-form, two different binary complexes and the ternary complex are described here. The two binary complexes contained NAD+ bound to 2 (mixed-holo) or 4 (holo) subunits of the tetrameric protein. The structure of the mixed-holo complex reveals the effects of NAD+ binding on the conformation of the protein. In the ternary complex, the phosphate group of the substrate was bound to the new Pi site in all four subunits. Comparison with the structure of human GAPDH showed several differences near the adenosyl binding pocket in Group B Streptococcus GAPDH. The structures also reveal at least three surface-exposed areas that differ in amino acid sequence compared to the corresponding areas of human GAPDH."

It exists as the α<sub>2</sub>βγ heterotetramer composed of the αβ and αγ heterodimers. Different from the αγ heterodimer that can be allosterically activated by CIT and ADP, the αβ heterodimer cannot be allosterically regulated by the activators; however, the molecular mechanism is unclear. We report here the crystal structures of the αβ heterodimer of human NAD-IDH with the α subunit in apo form and in Ca2+-bound, NAD-bound, and NADH-bound forms. Structural analyses and comparisons reveal that the αβ heterodimer has a similar yet more compact overall structure compared with the αγ heterodimer and contains a pseudo-allosteric site that is structurally different from the allosteric site. In particular, the β3-α3 and β12-α8 loops of the β subunit at the pseudo-allosteric site adopt significantly different conformations from those of the γ subunit at the allosteric site and hence impede the binding of the activators, explaining why the αβ heterodimer cannot be allosterically regulated by the activators. The structural data also show that NADH can compete with NAD to bind to the active site and inhibits the activity of the αβ heterodimer. These findings together with the biochemical data reveal the molecular basis for the function of the αβ heterodimer of human NAD-IDH."

Here we determined a 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 ExoN in complex with its essential co-factor, nsp10. The structure shows a highly basic and concave surface flanking the active site, comprising several Lys residues of nsp14 and the N-terminal amino group of nsp10. Modeling suggests that this basic patch binds to the template strand of double-stranded RNA substrates to position the 3' end of the nascent strand in the ExoN active site, which is corroborated by mutational and computational analyses. Molecular dynamics simulations further show remarkable flexibility of multi-domain nsp14 and suggest that nsp10 stabilizes ExoN for substrate RNA-binding to support its exoribonuclease activity. Our high-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ExoN-nsp10 complex serves as a platform for future development of anti-coronaviral drugs or strategies to attenuate the viral virulence."

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate pivotal molecular markers that may facilitate the diagnosis of EoE in pediatric patients.
METHODS: Three available EoE-associated gene expression datasets in children: GSE184182, GSE 197702, GSE55794, along with GSE173895 were downloaded from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified by ""limma"" were intersected with key module genes identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and the shared genes went through functional enrichment analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and the machine learning algorithms: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), and XGBoost were used to reveal candidate diagnostic markers for EoE. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed the efficacy of differential diagnosis of this marker, along with online databases predicting its molecular regulatory network. Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and assessed immune cell infiltration of EoE/control samples by using the CIBERSORT algorithm. The correlations between the key diagnostic biomarker and immune cells were also investigated.
RESULTS: The intersection of 936 DEGs and 1446 key module genes in EoE generated 567 genes, which were primarily enriched in immune regulation. Following the construction of the PPI network and filtration by machine learning, CXCR2 served as a potential diagnostic biomarker of pediatric EoE with a perfect diagnostic efficacy (AUC = ~1.00) in regional tissue/peripheral whole blood samples. Multiple infiltrated immune cells were observed to participate in disrupting the homeostasis of esophageal epithelium to varying degrees.
CONCLUSION: The immune-correlated CXCR2 gene was proved to be a promising diagnostic indicator for EoE, and dysregulated regulatory T cells (Tregs)/neutrophils might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of EoE in children."

This cross-sectional, retrospective, immunohistochemical study analyzed 30 compound odontomas, 30 complex odontomas, and 17 tooth germs. Higher immunoexpression of CK14 was observed in odontogenic epithelial cells of tooth germs (p < 0.001) and odontogenic epithelial cells of odontomas (p < 0.001). There was higher immunoexpression of Wnt-1 and β-catenin proteins in epithelial cells of tooth germs (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively), as well as in the ectomesenchyme of odontomas (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). β-Catenin was moderately and significantly correlated with CK14 in the membrane of reduced enamel epithelial cells in odontomas (p = 0.007). Higher immunoexpression of CK14 was observed in the odontogenic epithelium during the bud and cap stages and lower immunoexpression in the internal enamel epithelium during the bell stage. In odontomas, lower expression of Wnt-1/β-catenin and higher immunoexpression of CK14 were found in odontogenic epithelial cells, especially adjacent to the mineralized material resembling the tooth formed in these lesions."

Using data from these traits and multivariate genome-wide association study methods, we modeled their underlying genetic factor ('mvAge'). mvAge (effective n = ~1.9 million participants of European ancestry) identified 52 independent variants in 38 genomic loci. Twenty variants were novel (not reported in input genome-wide association studies). Transcriptomic imputation identified age-relevant genes, including VEGFA and PHB1. Drug-target Mendelian randomization with metformin target genes showed a beneficial impact on mvAge (P value = 8.41 × 10-5). Similarly, genetically proxied thiazolidinediones (P value = 3.50 × 10-10), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibition (P value = 1.62 × 10-6), angiopoietin-like protein 4, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers also had beneficial Mendelian randomization estimates. Extending the drug-target Mendelian randomization framework to 3,947 protein-coding genes prioritized 122 targets. Together, these findings will inform future studies aimed at improving healthy aging."

We described the molecular evaluation of the rare CFTR variant E583G identified in trans with the F508del in a novel haplotype.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An adult woman was referred to our pulmonary unit for persistent respiratory symptoms. CFTR Next Generation Sequencing was performed to evaluate full-gene mutational status. The variant identified was evaluated for its pathogenicity integrating clinical evidences with dedicated bioinformatics analyses. Clinical evaluation of patient matched with a mono-organ CFTR-RD diagnosis. Genotyping revealed the novel CFTR haplotype F508del/E583G. Multiple evidences of a deleterious effect of the CFTR E583G rare variant emerged from the bioinformatics analyses performed.
CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines for CFTR-RD are available with the purpose of harmonizing clinical and molecular investigations. In such context, the identification of novel CFTR haplotype need to a deeper evaluation with a combination of skills.

The prevalence and severity of the development of drug resistance has increased the challenge of coccidiosis control. We previously identified the enolase 2 of E. tenella (EtENO2) was differentially expressed in drug-sensitive (DS) and drug-resistant strains using RNA-seq. In this study, the expression of EtENO2 in diclazuril-resistant (DZR), maduramicin-resistant (MRR), and salinomycin-resistant (SMR) strains was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blots. EtENO2 was highly expressed in several drug-resistant strains compared with the DS strain. The qRT-PCR showed that the transcription level of EtENO2 in the field-isolated resistant strains was upregulated compared with the DS strain. The enzyme activity results indicated that the catalytic activity of EtENO2 in the drug-resistant strains was higher than in the DS strain. In addition, qRT-PCR and western blots showed that the expression level of EtENO2 was higher in second generation merozoites (SM) and unsporulated oocysts (UO) than that in sporozoites (SZ) and sporulated oocysts (SO). Immunofluorescence localization revealed that EtENO2 was distributed throughout SZ and SM and on the surface of the parasites. After the SZ invasion DF-1 cells, it was also observed on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Our secretion experiments found that EtENO2 could be secreted outside the SZ. This study indicated that EtENO2 might be related to the interaction between E. tenella and host cells and be involved in the development of E. tenella resistance to some anticoccidial drugs."

Little is known about the immunomodulatory effects of antifungal agents against these moulds. We examined the effects of deoxycholate and liposomal amphotericin B (DAmB, LAmB) and voriconazole on antifungal activities and immune responses of neutrophils (PMNs) against mature biofilms compared with their planktonic counterparts.
METHODS: Antifungal activity of human PMNs exposed to mature biofilms and planktonic cells for 24 h was determined at effector-to-target ratios of 2:1 and 5:1, alone or combined with DAmB, LAmB and voriconazole, assessed as fungal damage by XTT assay. Cytokine production was evaluated by multiplex ELISA, following PMN stimulation with biofilms in the presence/absence of each drug.
RESULTS: All drugs showed additive or synergistic effects with PMNs against S. apiospermum at 0.03-32 mg/L. They showed antagonism primarily against FSSC at 0.06-64 mg/L. Increased IL-8 was produced by PMNs exposed to S. apiospermum biofilms plus DAmB or voriconazole compared with PMNs exposed to biofilms alone (P < 0.01). During combined exposure, IL-1β was increased, an effect only counteracted by increased levels of IL-10 caused by DAmB (P < 0.01). LAmB and voriconazole caused similar IL-10 levels with those released by biofilm-exposed PMNs.
CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects of DAmB, LAmB or voriconazole on biofilm-exposed PMNs are organism-specific, with FSSC exhibiting greater resilience than S. apiospermum to antifungals. Biofilms of both moulds caused dampened immune responses. The drug-mediated immunomodulating effect on PMNs, evidenced by IL-1β, enhanced host protective functions."

Previous studies underline the challenges to identify the optimal combinations and ratios of individual ECM proteins for promoting survival and function of isolated and transplanted islets. This study aimed on assessing the efficiency of solubilized natural ECM extracted from juvenile pigs, an unlimited donor source. Isolated human islets were cultured under a hypoxic atmosphere (2% oxygen) in media supplemented with either solubilized porcine pancreatic ECM (ppECM) or a mixture of human ECM proteins composed of collagen-IV, laminin-521, and nidogen-1 (hEPM). Control islets were cultured under identical conditions without ECM-compounds. Reactive oxygen species production increased three-fold in controls but was reduced by hEPM or ppECM. Early apoptosis remained on preculture levels when islets were treated with hEPM or ppECM. Preculture viability was preserved when hEPM or ppECM was administered. Whilst controls failed to respond to glucose challenge, treatment with hEPM or ppECM preserved the physiological insulin response. In summary, overall survival was significantly highest in ppECM-treated islets. This study presents a new approach to protect human islets from hypoxia-induced damage by supplementing media with ppECM extracted from an unlimited donor source. The findings may also serve as starting point for a novel encapsulation technique to protect isolated human islets."

However, the role of the AREG/EGFR/HIF-1α pathway in regulating interleukin-9 (IL-9) production by T cells in adult patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) has not been fully elucidated. Fifty IM patients and 20 controls were enrolled. The percentages of Th9 and T cytotoxic 9 (Tc9) cells, the mRNA relative expressions of the transcription factors of IL-9-secreting T cells, purine-rich nucleic acid binding protein 1 (PU.1) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), and the levels of IL-9, AREG, EGFR, and HIF-1α were measured. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from IM patients were stimulated with EGFR inhibitor or exogenous AREG in the presence or absence of anti-HIF-1α. Regulation of the AREG/EGFR/HIF-1α pathway to IL-9 production by T cells was assessed. The percentages of Th9 and Tc9 cells, plasma IL-9 levels, and PU.1 and FOXO1 mRNA expressions were elevated in IM patients. Plasma levels of AREG and HIF-1α were also increased in IM patients. AREG levels correlated positively with the percentages of Th9 and Tc9 cells in IM patients. Inhibition of EGFR suppressed IL-9-producing T cell differentiation and HIF-1α production. Exogenous AREG stimulation not only induced EGFR and HIF-1α expression but also promoted IL-9-secreting T cell differentiation. Neutralization of HIF-1α abrogated AREG/EGFR-induced Th9 and Tc9 differentiation in IM patients. The current data suggested that the AREG/EGFR/HIF-1α pathway contributed to the elevation of Th9 and Tc9 differentiation in IM patients."

Carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) is a posttranscriptional global regulator and a critical determinant of H. pylori's motility and pathogenicity. The regulation of H. pylori CsrA is still uncertain although in other species CsrA is reported to be antagonized by small RNAs and proteins. In this study, we attempted to unveil how CsrA is regulated and hypothesized that H. pylori CsrA activity is antagonized by a flagellar assembly factor, FliW2, via protein allosteric obstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple sequence comparisons indicated that, along its length and in contrast to fliW1, the fliW2 of H. pylori J99 is conserved. We then generated an isogenic ΔfliW2 strain whose function was characterized using phenotypic and biochemical approaches. We also applied a machine learning approach (AlphaFold2) to predict FliW2-CsrA binding domains and investigated the FliW2-CsrA interaction using pull-down assays and in vivo bacterial two-hybrid systems.
RESULTS: We observed the reduced expression of major flagellin FlaA and impaired flagellar filaments that attenuated the motility of the ΔfliW2 strain. Furthermore, a direct interaction between FliW2 and CsrA was demonstrated, and a novel region of the C-terminal extension of CsrA was suggested to be crucial for CsrA interacting with FliW2. Based on our AlphaFold2 prediction, this C-terminal region of FliW2-CsrA interaction does not overlap with CsrA's N-terminal RNA binding domain, implying that FliW2 allosterically antagonizes CsrA activity and restricts CsrA's binding to flaA mRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data points to novel regulatory roles that the H. pylori flagellar assembly factor FliW2 has in obstructing CsrA activity, and thus FliW2 may indirectly antagonize CsrA's regulation of flaA mRNA processing and translation. Our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of flagellar motility in H. pylori."

In this study, we discovered that the N-terminal region of Efb (Efb-N) promotes platelet binding of fibrinogen and that Efb-N binding to platelets proceeds via two independent mechanisms: fibrinogen-mediated and fibrinogen-independent. By proteomic analysis of Efb-interacting proteins within platelets and confirmation by pulldown assays followed by immunoblotting, we identified P-selectin and multimerin-1 as novel Efb interaction partners. The interaction of both P-selectin and multimerin-1 with Efb is independent of fibrinogen. We focused on Efb interaction with P-selectin. Excess of P-selectin extracellular domain significantly impaired Efb binding by activated platelets, suggesting that P-selectin is the main receptor for Efb on the surface of activated platelets. Efb-N interaction with P-selectin inhibited P-selectin binding to its physiological ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), both in cell lysates and in cell-free assays. Because of the importance of P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding in the interaction between platelets and leukocytes, we tested human whole blood and found that Efb abolishes the formation of platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte complexes. In summary, we present evidence that in addition to its documented antithrombotic activity, Efb can play an immunoregulatory role via inhibition of P-selectin-PSGL-1-dependent formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes."

In Escherichia coli, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway. Previous studies reported many residues of SecM peptide and ribosome exit tunnel are critical for stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still not clear at the atomic level. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution, which reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome."

However, there is evidence indicating that ovariectomy prevents the development of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer, suggesting that estrogen signaling is involved in the development of ER-negative breast cancer. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36 mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling and is highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in 10/12 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. We investigated the role of mitogenic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of ER-α36 and found that these cells strongly responded to mitogenic estrogen signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the small hairpin RNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen. ER-α36 physically interacted with the EGFR/Src/Shc complex and mediated estrogen-induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src. EGFR signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter, and ER-α36 expression was able to stabilize EGFR protein. Our results, thus demonstrated that ER-α36 mediates nongenomic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway in ER-negative breast cancer cells and suggested that a subset of ER-negative breast tumors that expresses ER-α36, retains responsiveness to mitogenic estrogen signaling."

GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, marking it for ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome. Thus in regulation of the Wnt pathway, the ubiquitin system is known to be involved mostly in mediating the turnover of β-catenin, resulting in reduced Wnt signaling levels. Here we report that an arm of the ubiquitin system increases β-catenin protein levels. We show that GSK-3β directly interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase identified by differential display (EDD) that also binds β-catenin. Expression of EDD leads to enhanced nuclear accumulation of both GSK-3β and β-catenin and results in up-regulation of β-catenin expression levels and activity. Importantly, EDD ubiquitinates β-catenin through Lys29- or Lys11-linked ubiquitin chains, leading to enhanced stability of β-catenin. Our results demonstrate a role for the ubiquitin system in up-regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, suggesting that EDD could function as a colorectal oncogene."

Increased cellular c-di-GMP levels lead to stable cell attachment, which in Pseudomonas fluorescens requires the transmembrane receptor LapD. LapD exhibits a conserved and widely used modular architecture containing a HAMP domain and degenerate diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase domains. c-di-GMP binding to the LapD degenerate phosphodiesterase domain is communicated via the HAMP relay to the periplasmic domain, triggering sequestration of the protease LapG, thus preventing cleavage of the surface adhesin LapA. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanism of autoinhibition and activation of LapD based on structure-function analyses and crystal structures of the entire periplasmic domain and the intracellular signaling unit in two different states. In the absence of c-di-GMP, the intracellular module assumes an inactive conformation. Binding of c-di-GMP to the phosphodiesterase domain disrupts the inactive state, permitting the formation of a trans-subunit dimer interface between adjacent phosphodiesterase domains via interactions conserved in c-di-GMP-degrading enzymes. Efficient mechanical coupling of the conformational changes across the membrane is realized through an extensively domain-swapped, unique periplasmic fold. Our structural and functional analyses identified a conserved system for the regulation of periplasmic proteases in a wide variety of bacteria, including many free-living and pathogenic species."

One subset of Rap proteins consists of phosphatases that control B. subtilis and B. anthracis sporulation by dephosphorylating the response regulator Spo0F. The mechanistic basis of Rap phosphatase activity was unknown. Here we present the RapH-Spo0F X-ray crystal structure, which shows that Rap proteins consist of a 3-helix bundle and a tetratricopeptide repeat domain. Extensive biochemical and genetic functional studies reveal the importance of the observed RapH-Spo0F interactions, including the catalytic role of a glutamine in the RapH 3-helix bundle that inserts into the Spo0F active site. We show that in addition to dephosphorylating Spo0F, RapH can antagonize sporulation by sterically blocking phosphoryl transfer to and from Spo0F. Our structure-function analysis of the RapH-Spo0F interaction identified Rap protein residues critical for Spo0F phosphatase activity. This information enabled us to assign Spo0F phosphatase activity to a Rap protein based on sequence alone, which was not previously possible. Finally, as the ultimate test of our newfound understanding of the structural requirements for Rap phosphatase function, a non-phosphatase Rap protein that inhibits the binding of the response regulator ComA to DNA was rationally engineered to dephosphorylate Spo0F. In addition to revealing the mechanistic basis of response regulator dephosphorylation by Rap proteins, our studies support the previously proposed T-loop-Y allostery model of receiver domain regulation that restricts the aromatic ""switch"" residue to an internal position when the β4-α4 loop adopts an active-site proximal conformation."

Accumulating evidence shows that virus infection impacts L1 expression, potentially impacting host antiviral response and diseases. The underlying regulation mechanism is unclear. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a double-stranded DNA virus linked to B-cell and epithelial malignancies, is known to have viral-host genome interaction, resulting in transcriptional rewiring in EBV-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC). By analyzing publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we found that EBVaGC has L1 transcriptional repression compared with EBV-negative gastric cancer (EBVnGC). More specifically, retrotransposition-associated young and full-length L1s (FL-L1s) were among the most repressed L1s. Epigenetic alterations, especially increased H3K9me3, were observed on FL-L1s. H3K9me3 deposition was potentially attributed to increased TASOR expression, a key component of the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex for H3K9 trimethylation. The 4C- and HiC-seq data indicated that the viral DNA interacted in the proximity of the TASOR enhancer, strengthening the loop formation between the TASOR enhancer and its promoter. These results indicated that EBV infection is associated with increased H3K9me3 deposition, leading to L1 repression. This study uncovers a regulation mechanism of L1 expression by chromatin topology remodeling associated with viral-host genome interaction in EBVaGC."

Nonetheless, the epigenetic regulation of ground-state mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is not fully understood. Here, we identify the epigenetic protein MPP8 as being essential for ground-state pluripotency. Its depletion leads to cell cycle arrest and spontaneous differentiation. MPP8 has been suggested to repress LINE1 elements by recruiting the human silencing hub (HUSH) complex to H3K9me3-rich regions. Unexpectedly, we find that LINE1 elements are efficiently repressed by MPP8 lacking the chromodomain, while the unannotated C-terminus is essential for its function. Moreover, we show that SETDB1 recruits MPP8 to its genomic target loci, whereas transcriptional repression of LINE1 elements is maintained without retaining H3K9me3 levels. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that MPP8 protects the DNA-hypomethylated pluripotent ground state through its association with the HUSH core complex, however, independently of detectable chromatin binding and maintenance of H3K9me3."

One of such loci CDH1, encoding E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein with known tumor suppressor functions, is also linked to the susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Loss of membranous E-cadherin expression is common in both colitis and cancer. We have recently demonstrated that mesalamine (5-ASA); the anti-inflammatory drug used to treat ulcerative colitis, induces membranous expression of E-cadherin and increases intercellular adhesion. Using colorectal cancer epithelial cells with aberrant E-cadherin expression, we investigated the mechanism underlying such an effect of 5-ASA. Post-translational modification of E-cadherin glycosylation was analyzed by biotin/streptavidin detection of sialylated glycoproteins. GnT-III (N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III) expression was assessed by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. GnT-III activity was analyzed by reactivity with E-4/L-4-PHA. Expression, localization and interaction of E-cadherin and β-catenin were analyzed by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and RNA interference. 5-ASA activity modulated E-cadherin glycosylation and increased both mRNA and protein levels of GnT-III and its activity as detected by increased E4-lectin reactivity. Intestinal APC(Min) polyps in mice showed low expression of GnT-III and 5-ASA was effective in increasing its expression. The data demonstrated that remodeling of glycans by GnT-III mediated bisect glycosylation, contributes to the membranous retention of E-cadherin by 5-ASA; facilitating intercellular adhesion. Induction of membranous expression of E-cadherin by 5-ASA is a novel mechanism for mucosal healing in colitis that might impede tumor progression by modulation of GnT-III expression."

They have been shown to be a cause of single-gene diseases. Moreover, L1-encoded endonuclease can elicit double-strand breaks that may lead to genomic instability. Mammalian cells adopted strategies restricting mobility and deleterious consequences of uncontrolled retrotransposition. The human APOBEC3 protein family of polynucleotide cytidine deaminases contributes to intracellular defense against retroelements. APOBEC3 members inhibit L1 retrotransposition by 35-99%. However, genomic L1 retrotransposition events that occurred in the presence of L1-restricting APOBEC3 proteins are devoid of detectable G-to-A hypermutations, suggesting one or multiple deaminase-independent L1 restricting mechanisms. We set out to uncover the mechanism of APOBEC3C (A3C)-mediated L1 inhibition and found that it is deaminase independent, requires an intact dimerization site and the RNA-binding pocket mutation R122A abolishes L1 restriction by A3C. Density gradient centrifugation of L1 ribonucleoprotein particles, subcellular co-localization of L1-ORF1p and A3C and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that an RNA-dependent physical interaction between L1 ORF1p and A3C dimers is essential for L1 restriction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the amount of L1 complementary DNA synthesized by L1 reverse transcriptase is reduced by ≈ 50% if overexpressed A3C is present."

It encodes ORF1p and ORF2p which form an L1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with their encoding transcript that is copied into genomic DNA (retrotransposition). ORF1p binds single-stranded nucleic acid (ssNA) and exhibits NA chaperone activity. All vertebrate ORF1ps contain a coiled coil (CC) domain and we previously showed that a CC-retrotransposition null mutant prevented formation of stably bound ORF1p complexes on ssNA. Here, we compared CC variants using our recently improved method that measures ORF1p binding to ssDNA at different forces. Bound proteins decrease ssDNA contour length and at low force, retrotransposition-competent ORF1ps (111p and m14p) exhibit two shortening phases: the first is rapid, coincident with ORF1p binding; the second is slower, consistent with formation of tightly compacted complexes by NA-bound ORF1p. In contrast, two retrotransposition-null CC variants (151p and m15p) did not attain the second tightly compacted state. The C-terminal half of the ORF1p trimer (not the CC) contains the residues that mediate NA-binding. Our demonstrating that the CC governs the ability of NA-bound retrotransposition-competent trimers to form tightly compacted complexes reveals the biochemical phenotype of these coiled coil mutants."

Here, we report that Numb interacts with E-cadherin (E-cad) through its phosphotyrosine-binding domain (PTB) and thereby regulates the localization of E-cad to the lateral domain of epithelial cell-cell junction. Moreover, Numb engages the polarity complex Par3-aPKC-Par6 by binding to Par3 in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Intriguingly, after Src activation or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) treatment, Numb decouples from E-cad and Par3 and associates preferably with aPKC-Par6. Binding of Numb to aPKC is necessary for sequestering the latter in the cytosol during HGF-induced EMT. Knockdown of Numb by small hairpin RNA caused a basolateral-to-apicolateral translocation of E-cad and beta-catenin accompanied by elevated actin polymerization, accumulation of Par3 and aPKC in the nucleus, an enhanced sensitivity to HGF-induced cell scattering, a decrease in cell-cell adhesion, and an increase in cell migration. Our work identifies Numb as an important regulator of epithelial polarity and cell-cell adhesion and a sensor of HGF signalling or Src activity during EMT."

APP are mainly synthesised by hepatocytes and their transcription is induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1). The molecular mechanisms underlying the IL-1-induced expression of key transcription factors implicated in the regulation of APP are poorly understood. We have investigated this aspect using the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-delta (C/EBPdelta) as a model gene. IL-1 induced the expression of C/EBPdelta mRNA and protein in the human hepatoma Hep3B cell line, a widely employed model system for studies on cytokine signalling in relation to the expression of APP. The IL-1-mediated induction of C/EBPdelta expression was attenuated in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors against c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (curcumin and SP600125), casein kinase 2 (CK2) (apigenin) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) (NF-kappaB activation inhibitor). RNA interference assays showed significant attenuation of the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta following knockdown of the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB. IL-1 induced NF-kappaB DNA binding and activation by this transcription factor and this was attenuated by curcumin and apigenin. Taken together, these results suggest a potentially crucial role for NF-kappaB in the IL-1-induced expression of C/EBPdelta, and thereby downstream APP genes regulated by this transcription factor."

However, the mechanisms regulating this phenomenon and its functional consequences are still under investigation. Here, we reveal that cadherin complexes at the apical zonula adherens (ZA) of epithelial adherens junctions recruit the core components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Ago2, GW182, and PABPC1, as well as a set of 522 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and 28 mature microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), via PLEKHA7. Top canonical pathways represented by these mRNAs include Wnt/β-catenin, TGF-β, and stem cell signaling. We specifically demonstrate the presence and silencing of MYC, JUN, and SOX2 mRNAs by miR-24 and miR-200c at the ZA. PLEKHA7 knockdown dissociates RISC from the ZA, decreases loading of the ZA-associated mRNAs and miRNAs to Ago2, and results in a corresponding increase of MYC, JUN, and SOX2 protein expression. The present work reveals a mechanism that directly links junction integrity to the silencing of a set of mRNAs that critically affect epithelial homeostasis."

The contribution of the transmembrane domain in the dimerization and signaling process has heretofore been overlooked in favor of the extracellular and intracellular domains. As mounting evidence suggests that the transmembrane domain is a critical region in several protein families, we hypothesized that this was also the case for Toll-like receptors. Using a combined biochemical and biophysical approach, we investigated the ability of isolated Toll-like receptor transmembrane domains to interact independently of extracellular domain dimerization. Our results showed that the transmembrane domains had a preference for the native dimer partners in bacterial membranes for the entire receptor family. All TLR transmembrane domains showed strong homotypic interaction potential. The TLR2 transmembrane domain demonstrated strong heterotypic interactions in bacterial membranes with its known interaction partners, TLR1 and TLR6, as well as with a proposed interaction partner, TLR10, but not with TLR4, TLR5, or unrelated transmembrane receptors providing evidence for the specificity of TLR2 transmembrane domain interactions. Peptides for the transmembrane domains of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 were synthesized to further study this subfamily of receptors. These peptides validated the heterotypic interactions seen in bacterial membranes and demonstrated that the TLR2 transmembrane domain had moderately strong interactions with both TLR1 and TLR6. Combined, these results suggest a role for the transmembrane domain in Toll-like receptor oligomerization and as such, may be a novel target for further investigation of new therapeutic treatments of Toll-like receptor mediated diseases."

Binding of PHF1 to H3K36me3 inhibits the ability of the Polycomb PRC2 complex to methylate Lys27 of histone H3 in vitro and in vivo. Laser microirradiation data show that PHF1 is transiently recruited to DNA double-strand breaks, and PHF1 mutants impaired in the H3K36me3 interaction exhibit reduced retention at double-strand break sites. Together, our findings suggest that PHF1 can mediate deposition of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and acts as a cofactor in early DNA-damage response."

Bovine Adeno-Associated Virus (BAAV) uses plasma membrane gangliosides for transduction and infection. In addition, independent of the infectious pathway, BAAV also has the ability to pass through barrier epithelia and endothelia using a transcytosis pathway dependent upon the presence of cell surface carbohydrates. Thus, in order to better define the carbohydrate interactions that are necessary for BAAV infection or transcytosis, a glycan microarray composed of both natural and synthetic carbohydrates was probed with HA-tagged BAAV particles. This identified chitotriose, a trimer of beta-1-4-linked N-acetyl glucosamine, as having an interaction with BAAV. Competition experiments showed that the BAAV interaction with this carbohydrate is not necessary for infection but is instead important in the transcytosis pathway. The beta-1-4-linked N-acetyl glucosamine modification has been reported on gp96, a glycoprotein involved in the transcytosis of bacteria and toxins. Significantly, immunoprecipitation and competition experiments with an anti-gp96 antibody and a soluble form of gp96, respectively, showed this glycoprotein can also interact with BAAV to serve as a receptor for its transcytosis."

Analysis of the gene expression profile from COVID-19 patients as well as SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cell lines reveals that the induction of the MHC class I pathway is inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that NLRC5, an MHC class I transactivator, is suppressed both transcriptionally and functionally by the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein, providing a mechanistic link. SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 hampers type II interferon-mediated STAT1 signaling, resulting in diminished upregulation of NLRC5 and IRF1 gene expression. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 inhibits NLRC5 function via blocking karyopherin complex-dependent nuclear import of NLRC5.

Here, we report an efficient, simple, scalable, robust AAV5 production process utilizing the most recent modification of the OneBac platform. An increase in volumetric yield of genomic particles by ∼6-fold and functional particles by ∼20-fold was achieved by operating a high-cell-density process in shake flasks and bioreactors that involves an Sf9-based rep/cap stable cell line grown at a density of about 10 million cells/mL infected with a single baculovirus. The overall volumetric yields of genomic (VG) and bioactive particles (enhanced transducing units [ETUs]) in representative fedbatch bioreactor runs ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 × 1014 VG/L and from 1 to 2 × 1011 ETU/L. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses of affinity-purified AAV vector samples from side-by-side batch and fedbatch production runs showed vector preparations with a full and empty particle distribution of 20%-30% genomic and 70%-80% empty particles.

However, it is poorly understood how SARS-CoV-2 utilize host endocytic transport pathways to produce productive infection. Here, we report that SNX27 interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to facilitate S protein surface expression. Interestingly, S protein binds to the PDZ domain of SNX27, although it does not contain a PDZ-binding motif (PDZbm). Either abrogation of the SNX27 PDZ domain or S protein ""MTSC"" motif, which is critical for SNX27 binding, decreases surface expression of S protein and viral production.

To investigate the interplay between the L1 retrotransposition machinery and the host cell, we used co-immunoprecipitation in conjunction with liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify cellular proteins that interact with the L1 first open reading frame-encoded protein, ORF1p. We identified 39 ORF1p-interacting candidate proteins including the zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP or ZC3HAV1). Here we show that the interaction between ZAP and ORF1p requires RNA and that ZAP overexpression in HeLa cells inhibits the retrotransposition of engineered human L1 and Alu elements, an engineered mouse L1, and an engineered zebrafish LINE-2 element. Consistently, siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous ZAP in HeLa cells led to a ~2-fold increase in human L1 retrotransposition. Fluorescence microscopy in cultured human cells demonstrated that ZAP co-localizes with L1 RNA, ORF1p, and stress granule associated proteins in cytoplasmic foci. Finally, molecular genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that ZAP reduces the accumulation of full-length L1 RNA and the L1-encoded proteins, yielding mechanistic insight about how ZAP may inhibit L1 retrotransposition. Together, these data suggest that ZAP inhibits the retrotransposition of LINE and Alu elements."

Their pathogenicity is mediated by at least 40 effector proteins which they inject into their host cells by a type-III secretion system leading to the subversion of several cellular pathways. However, the molecular function of several effectors remains unknown, even though they contribute to virulence. Here we show that one of them, NleF, binds to caspase-4, -8, and -9 in yeast two-hybrid, LUMIER, and direct interaction assays. NleF inhibits the catalytic activity of the caspases in vitro and in cell lysate and prevents apoptosis in HeLa and Caco-2 cells. We have solved the crystal structure of the caspase-9/NleF complex which shows that NleF uses a novel mode of caspase inhibition, involving the insertion of the carboxy-terminus of NleF into the active site of the protease. In conformance with our structural model, mutagenized NleF with truncated or elongated carboxy-termini revealed a complete loss in caspase binding and apoptosis inhibition. Evasion of apoptosis helps pathogenic E. coli and other pathogens to take over the host cell by counteracting the cell's ability to self-destruct upon infection. Recently, two other effector proteins, namely NleD and NleH, were shown to interfere with apoptosis. Even though NleF is not the only effector protein capable of apoptosis inhibition, direct inhibition of caspases by bacterial effectors has not been reported to date. Also unique so far is its mode of inhibition that resembles the one obtained for synthetic peptide-type inhibitors and as such deviates substantially from previously reported caspase-9 inhibitors such as the BIR3 domain of XIAP."

Any impairment in astroglial function can ultimately lead to generalized disturbance in the brain, thus pharmacological targets associated with prevention of astrocyte death are actually promising. Subtype 3 of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3) is present in astrocytes, its activation exerting neuroprotective roles. In fact, we have previously demonstrated that mGluR3 selective agonists prevent nitric oxide (NO)-induced astrocyte death. However, mechanisms responsible for that cytoprotective property are still subject to study. Although inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by mGluR3 activation was extensively reported, the involvement of reduced cAMP levels in the effects of mGluR3 agonists and the association between cAMP decrease and the downstream pathways activated by mGluR3 remain neglected. Thus, we studied intracellular signaling mediating anti-apoptotic actions of mGluR3 in cultured rat astrocytes exposed to NO. In the present work, we showed that the cytoprotective effect of mGluR3 agonists (LY379268 and LY404039) requires both the reduction of intracellular cAMP levels and activation of Akt, as assessed by MTT and TUNEL techniques. Moreover, dibutyryl-cAMP impairs Akt phosphorylation induced by LY404039, indicating a relationship between mGluR3-reduced cAMP levels and PI3K/Akt pathway activation. We also demonstrated, by co-immunoprecipitation followed by western-blot, that the mGluR3 agonists not only induce per se survival-linked interaction between members of the NF-κB family p65 and c-Rel, but also impede reduction of levels of p65-c-Rel dimers caused by NO, suggesting a possible anti-apoptotic role for p65-c-Rel. All together, these data suggest that mGluR3 agonists may regulate cAMP/Akt/p65-c-Rel pathway, which would contribute to the protective effect of mGluR3 against NO challenge in astrocytes. Our results widen the knowledge about mechanisms of action of mGluR3, potential targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders where a pathophysiological role for NO has been established."

The transmembrane co-chaperonin was prepared by recombination of GroES functional elements with the nanopore, suggesting that emergent functions in molecular machines can be added bottom-up by incorporating modular elements into preexisting protein scaffolds. The binding of a single-ring version of GroEL to individual GroES nanopores prompted large changes to the unitary nanopore current, most likely reflecting the allosteric transitions of the chaperonin apical domains. One of the GroEL-induced current levels showed fast fluctuations (<1 ms), a characteristic that might be instrumental for efficient substrate encapsulation or folding. In the presence of unfolded proteins, the pattern of current transitions changed, suggesting a possible mechanism in which the free energy of adenosine triphosphate binding and hydrolysis is expended only when substrate proteins are occupied."

In the brain, TREM2 is highly expressed on the cell surface of microglia, where it can transduce signals to regulate microglial functions such as phagocytosis. To date, mechanisms underlying intracellular trafficking of TREM2 remain elusive. Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) catalytic subunit of the γ-secretase complex have been associated with increased generation of the amyloidogenic Aβ (amyloid-β) 42 peptide through cleavage of the Aβ precursor amyloid precursor protein. Here we found that TREM2 interacts with PS1 in a manner independent of γ-secretase activity. Mutations in TREM2 alter its subcellular localization and affects its interaction with PS1. Upregulation of PS1 reduces, whereas downregulation of PS1 increases, steady-state levels of cell surface TREM2. Furthermore, PS1 overexpression results in attenuated phagocytic uptake of Aβ by microglia, which is reversed by TREM2 overexpression.

However, the expression of ACE2 is extremely low in a variety of human tissues, especially in the airways. Thus, other coreceptors and/or cofactors on the surface of host cells may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we identified nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYH9) as an important host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection of human pulmonary cells by using APEX2 proximity-labeling techniques. Genetic ablation of MYH9 significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in wild type (WT) A549 and Calu-3 cells, and overexpression of MYH9 enhanced the pseudovirus infection in WT A549 and H1299 cells. MYH9 was colocalized with the SARS-CoV-2 S and directly interacted with SARS-CoV-2 S through the S2 subunit and S1-NTD (N-terminal domain) by its C-terminal domain (designated as PRA). Further experiments suggested that endosomal or myosin inhibitors effectively block the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 into PRA-A549 cells, while transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin B and L (CatB/L) inhibitors do not, indicating that MYH9 promotes SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis and bypasses TMPRSS2 and CatB/L pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that loss of MYH9 reduces authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3, ACE2-A549, and ACE2-H1299 cells. Together, our results suggest that MYH9 is a candidate host factor for SARS-CoV-2, which mediates the virus entering host cells by endocytosis in an ACE2-dependent manner, and may serve as a potential target for future clinical intervention strategies."

The major NAT complex in yeast, NatA, is composed of the catalytic subunit Naa10p (N alpha acetyltransferase 10 protein) (Ard1p) and the auxiliary subunit Naa15p (Nat1p). The NatA complex potentially acetylates Ser-, Ala-, Thr-, Gly-, Val- and Cys- N-termini after Met-cleavage. In humans, the homologues hNaa15p (hNat1) and hNaa10p (hArd1) were demonstrated to form a stable ribosome associated NAT complex acetylating NatA type N-termini in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We here describe a novel human protein, hNaa16p (hNat2), with 70% sequence identity to hNaa15p (hNat1). The gene encoding hNaa16p originates from an early vertebrate duplication event from the common ancestor of hNAA15 and hNAA16. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified both endogenous hNaa15p and hNaa16p as distinct interaction partners of hNaa10p in HEK293 cells, thus demonstrating the presence of both hNaa15p-hNaa10p and hNaa16p-hNaa10p complexes. The hNaa16p-hNaa10p complex acetylates NatA type N-termini in vitro. hNaa16p is ribosome associated, supporting its potential role in cotranslational Nalpha-terminal acetylation. hNAA16 is expressed in a variety of human cell lines, but is generally less abundant as compared to hNAA15. Specific knockdown of hNAA16 induces cell death, suggesting an essential role for hNaa16p in human cells.
CONCLUSION: At least two distinct NatA protein Nalpha-terminal acetyltransferases coexist in human cells potentially creating a more complex and flexible system for Nalpha-terminal acetylation as compared to lower eukaryotes."

So far, development of tool compounds that target enzymes of the ubiquitin system has been slow and only a few specific inhibitors are available. Here, we report the selection of single-domain antibodies (single-dAbs) based on a human scaffold that recognize the catalytic domain of HOIP, a subunit of the multi-component E3 LUBAC and member of the RBR family of E3 ligases. Some of these dAbs affect ligase activity and provide mechanistic insight into the ubiquitin transfer mechanism of different E2-conjugating enzymes. Furthermore, we show that the co-crystal structure of a HOIP RBR/dAb complex serves as a robust platform for soaking of ligands that target the active site cysteine of HOIP, thereby providing easy access to structure-based ligand design for this important class of E3 ligases."

L1 spreads through a mechanism termed target-primed reverse transcription, in which the encoded enzyme (ORF2p) nicks the target DNA to prime reverse transcription of its own or non-self RNAs2. Here we purified full-length L1 ORF2p and biochemically reconstituted robust target-primed reverse transcription with template RNA and target-site DNA. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the complete human L1 ORF2p bound to structured template RNAs and initiating cDNA synthesis. The template polyadenosine tract is recognized in a sequence-specific manner by five distinct domains. Among them, an RNA-binding domain bends the template backbone to allow engagement of an RNA hairpin stem with the L1 ORF2p C-terminal segment. Moreover, structure and biochemical reconstitutions demonstrate an unexpected target-site requirement: L1 ORF2p relies on upstream single-stranded DNA to position the adjacent duplex in the endonuclease active site for nicking of the longer DNA strand, with a single nick generating a staggered DNA break. Our research provides insights into the mechanism of ongoing transposition in the human genome and informs the engineering of retrotransposon proteins for gene therapy."

We have previously shown that the regulatory region of human and murine L1s interact with retinoblastoma (RB) proteins to effect retroelement silencing. The present studies were conducted to identify the corepressor complex responsible for RB-mediated silencing of L1.
METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation and silencing RNA technology were used to identify the repressor complex that silences L1 in human and murine cells.
RESULTS: Components of the Nucleosomal and Remodeling Deacetylase (NuRD) multiprotein complex specifically enriched the L1 5'-untranslated DNA sequence in human and murine cells. Genetic ablation of RB proteins in murine cells destabilized interactions within the NuRD macromolecular complex and mediated nuclear rearrangement of Mi2-β, an ATP-dependent helicase subunit with nucleosome remodeling activity. Depletion of Mi2-β, RbAP46 and HDAC2 reduced the repressor activity of the NuRD complex and reactivated a synthetic L1 reporter in human cells. Epigenetic reactivation of L1 in RB-null cells by DNA damage was markedly enhanced compared to wild type cells.
CONCLUSIONS: RB proteins stabilize interactions of the NuRD corepressor complex within the L1 promoter to effect L1 silencing. L1 retroelements may serve as a scaffold on which RB builds heterochromatic regions that regulate chromatin function."

We used NMR and X-ray crystallography to study the C3d-FH19-20 complex in atomic detail and identify glycosaminoglycan-binding residues in factor H module 20 of the C3d-FH19-20 complex. Mutagenesis justified the merging of the C3d-FH19-20 structure with an existing C3b-FH1-4 crystal structure. We concatenated the merged structure with the available FH6-8 crystal structure and new SAXS-derived FH1-4, FH8-15 and FH15-19 envelopes.

While transposition-competent transposable elements must be repressed to maintain genomic stability, mutated and fragmented transposable elements comprising the bulk of repetitive sequences can also contribute to regulation of host gene expression and broader genome organization. Here, we analyzed published ChIP-seq data sets to identify proteins broadly enriched on transposable elements in the human genome. We show 2 of the proteins identified, C2H2 zinc finger-containing proteins ZNF146 (also known as OZF) and ZNF507, are targeted to distinct sites within LINE-1 ORF2 at thousands of locations in the genome. ZNF146 binding sites are found at old and young LINE-1 elements. In contrast, ZNF507 preferentially binds at young LINE-1 sequences correlated to sequence changes in LINE-1 elements at ZNF507's binding site. To gain further insight into ZNF146 and ZNF507 function, we disrupt their expression in HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and perform RNA sequencing, finding modest gene expression changes in cells where ZNF507 has been disrupted.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that a physical interaction between transcription factor FOXP3 and the epigenetic enzyme enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is essential for gene co-repressive function.
METHODS: Human FOXP3 mutations clinically relevant to intestinal inflammation were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. T lymphocytes were isolated from mice, human blood, and lamina propria of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and non-CD controls. We performed proximity ligation or a co-immunoprecipitation assay in FOXP3-mutant+, interleukin 6 (IL6)-treated or CD-CD4+ T cells to assess FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction. We studied IL2 promoter activity and chromatin state of the interferon γ locus via luciferase reporter and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, in cells expressing FOXP3 mutants.
RESULTS: EZH2 binding was abrogated by inflammatory bowel disease-associated FOXP3 cysteine 232 (C232) mutation. The C232 mutant showed impaired repression of IL2 and diminished EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 on interferon γ, indicative of compromised Treg physiologic function. Generalizing this mechanism, IL6 impaired FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. IL6-induced effects were reversed by Janus kinase 1/2 inhibition. In lamina propria-derived CD4+T cells from CD patients, we observed decreased FOXP3-EZH2 interaction.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXP3-C232 mutation disrupts EZH2 recruitment and gene co-repressive function. The proinflammatory cytokine IL6 abrogates FOXP3-EZH2 interaction. Studies in lesion-derived CD4+ T cells have shown that reduced FOXP3-EZH2 interaction is a molecular feature of CD patients. Destabilized FOXP3-EZH2 protein interaction via diverse mechanisms and consequent Treg abnormality may drive gastrointestinal inflammation."

BC stem cells (BCSCs) have been known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of the breast and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of BC correlated with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapies that target PD-L1 have great potential and have been successful when applied to cancer treatment. However, whether PD-L1 regulates BCSC formation is unknown.
METHODS: BCSCs were enriched by serum-free suspension culture. The properties of BCSCs were examined by mammosphere formation assay, CD44+/Cd24-, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay, CSC marker analysis, and mammosphere growth assay. To elucidate the functions of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), nuclear PD-L1, and RelB proteins in the stemness of BCSCs, mammosphere formation was examined using BRD4 inhibitor and degrader, PD-L1 degrader, and RelB inhibitor. The antitumor function of 3',4',7,8-tetrahydroxyflavone (THF), a specific BRD4 inhibitor, was studied through in vivo tumor model and mouse studies, and the protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB were examined in tumor model under THF treatment.
RESULTS: BRD4 was upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates the stemness of BCs. The downregulation of BRD4 using BRD4 PROTAC, ARV-825, and BRD4 inhibitor, (+)-JQ1, inhibits mammosphere formation and reduces the levels of breast CSC markers (CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1), stem cell marker genes, and mammosphere growth. BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825) downregulate membrane and nuclear fractions of PD-L1 through the inhibition of PD-L1 transcript levels. The knockdown of PD-L1 inhibits mammosphere formation. Verteporfin, a PD-L1 degrader, inhibits the transcripts and protein levels of PD-L1 and downregulates the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Calcitriol, a RelB inhibitor, and the knockdown of RelB using si-RelB regulate mammosphere formation through interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. THF is a natural product and a potent selective BRD4 inhibitor, inhibits mammosphere formation, and reduces the levels of CD44+/CD24- and mammosphere growth by downregulating c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. 3',4',7,8-THF shows tumoricidal activity and increased levels of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in the murine tumor model using 4T1 and MC38 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show the first evidence of the essential role of the BRD4/nuclear PD-L1/RelB axis in breast CSC formation. The nuclear PD-L1 regulates RelB, and the RelB/p65 complex induces IL6 and breast CSC formation. Targeting nuclear PD-L1 represents a potential and novel tool for immunotherapies of intractable BC.

Here we studied three ORF1 proteins: a modern human one (111p), its resuscitated primate ancestor (555p) and a mosaic modern protein (151p) wherein 9 of the 30 coiled coil substitutions retain their ancestral state. While 111p and 555p equally supported retrotransposition, 151p was inactive. Nonetheless, they were fully active in bulk assays of nucleic acid interactions including chaperone activity. However, single molecule assays showed that 151p trimers form stably bound oligomers on ssDNA at <1/10th the rate of the active proteins, revealing that oligomerization rate is a novel critical parameter of ORF1p activity in retrotransposition conserved for at least the last 25 Myr of primate evolution."

We show here that its triple Tudor domain (3TD) specifically binds to doubly modified histone H3 containing K14 acetylation and K9 methylation. Crystal structures of 3TD in complex with H3K14ac/K9me peptides reveal that peptide binding and K14ac recognition occurs at the interface between Tudor domains (TD) TD2 and TD3. Structural and biochemical data demonstrate a pocket switch mechanism in histone code reading, because K9me1 or K9me2 is preferentially recognized by the aromatic cage of TD3, while K9me3 selectively binds to TD2. Mutations in the K14ac/K9me binding sites change the sub-nuclear localization of 3TD. ChIP-seq analyses show that SETDB1 is enriched at H3K9me3 regions and K9me3/K14ac is enriched at SETDB1 binding sites overlapping with LINE elements, suggesting that recruitment of the SETDB1 complex to K14ac/K9me regions has a role in silencing of active genomic regions."

These mechanisms involve RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which associate with transcripts to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes.
RESULTS: In this study, we report the identification of mRNA targets for Trypanosoma cruzi U-rich RBP 1 (TcUBP1) and T. cruzi RBP 3 (TcRBP3), two phylogenetically conserved proteins among Kinetoplastids. Co-immunoprecipitated RBP-associated RNAs were extracted from mRNP complexes and binding of RBPs to several targets was confirmed by independent experimental assays. Analysis of target transcript sequences allowed the identification of different signature RNA motifs for each protein. Cis-elements for RBP binding have a stem-loop structure of 30-35 bases and are more frequently represented in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. Insertion of the correctly folded RNA elements to a non-specific mRNA rendered it into a target transcript, whereas substitution of the RNA elements abolished RBP interaction. In addition, RBPs competed for RNA-binding sites in accordance with the distribution of different and overlapping motifs in the 3'-UTRs of common mRNAs.
CONCLUSION: Functionally related transcripts were preferentially associated with a given RBP; TcUBP1 targets were enriched in genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism, whereas ribosomal protein-encoding transcripts were the largest group within TcRBP3 targets. Together, these results suggest coordinated control of different mRNA subsets at the post-transcriptional level by specific RBPs."

Here, we propose an analytical approach to determine the peptide pattern as a quality attribute of Colagenart®, a product containing collagen hydrolysate. In addition, we evaluated the safety by measuring the viability of two cell lines exposed to the product. The consistency of peptide distribution was determined using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Mass Spectrometry coupled to a reversed phase UPLC system (MS-RP-UPLC), and Shaped-pulse off-resonance water-presaturation proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry [1 Hwater_presat NMR]. The mass distribution pattern determined by SEC was in a range from 1.35 to 17 kDa, and from 2 to 14 kDa by MS-RP-UPLC. [1 Hwater_presat NMR] showed the detailed spin-systems of the collagen hydrolysates components by global assignment of backbone Hα and NH, as well as side-chain proton resonances. Additionally, short-range intraresidue connectivity pathways of identified spin-regions were obtained by a 2D homonuclear shift correlation Shaped-pulse solvent suppression COSY scheme. Safety analysis of Colagenart® was evaluated in CaCo-2 and HepG2 cells at 2.5 and 25 μg/mL and no negative effects were observed.

Using kinase assays and western blotting, we confirm that P6 is a substrate for the inhibitory kappa B kinases (IKKs), IKKα and IKKβ, and, in human hepatic myofibroblasts, P6 prevents RelA-P-Ser536, but does not affect IKK activation of IκBα. We demonstrate that RelA-P-Ser536 is a feature of human lung and skin fibroblasts, but not lung epithelial cells, in vitro and is present in sclerotic skin and diseased lungs of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

We previously demonstrated that a part of human CHD7 interacts with a part of human CHD8, another chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein presumably being involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental (NDD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Because identification of novel CHD7 and CHD8 interacting partners will provide further insights into the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and ASD/NDD, we searched for additional associated polypeptides using the method of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with mass spectrometry.
PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The hitherto uncharacterized FAM124B (Family with sequence similarity 124B) was identified as a potential interaction partner of both CHD7 and CHD8. We confirmed the result by co-immunoprecipitation studies and showed a direct binding to the CHD8 part by direct yeast two hybrid experiments. Furthermore, we characterized FAM124B as a mainly nuclear localized protein with a widespread expression in embryonic and adult mouse tissues.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that FAM124B is a potential interacting partner of a CHD7 and CHD8 containing complex. From the overlapping expression pattern between Chd7 and Fam124B at murine embryonic day E12.5 and the high expression of Fam124B in the developing mouse brain, we conclude that Fam124B is a novel protein possibly involved in the pathogenesis of CHARGE syndrome and neurodevelopmental disorders."

Although inhibitors of membrane protein smoothened (SMO) effectively suppress HH signalling, early tumour resistance illustrates the need for additional downstream targets for therapy. Here we identify atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (aPKC-ι/λ) as a novel GLI regulator in mammals. aPKC-ι/λ and its polarity signalling partners co-localize at the centrosome and form a complex with missing-in-metastasis (MIM), a scaffolding protein that potentiates HH signalling. Genetic or pharmacological loss of aPKC-ι/λ function blocks HH signalling and proliferation of BCC cells. Prkci is a HH target gene that forms a positive feedback loop with GLI and exists at increased levels in BCCs. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that aPKC-ι/λ and SMO control the expression of similar genes in tumour cells. aPKC-ι/λ functions downstream of SMO to phosphorylate and activate GLI1, resulting in maximal DNA binding and transcriptional activation. Activated aPKC-ι/λ is upregulated in SMO-inhibitor-resistant tumours and targeting aPKC-ι/λ suppresses signalling and growth of resistant BCC cell lines. These results demonstrate that aPKC-ι/λ is critical for HH-dependent processes and implicates aPKC-ι/λ as a new, tumour-selective therapeutic target for the treatment of SMO-inhibitor-resistant cancers."

IST1 and its ESCRT-III binding partner, CHMP1B, both form higher-order helical structures in vitro, and IST1-CHMP1 interactions are required for abscission. The IST1 and CHMP3 structures also reveal that equivalent downstream alpha5 helices can fold back against the core domains. Mutations within the CHMP3 core-alpha5 interface stimulate the protein's in vitro assembly and HIV-inhibition activities, indicating that dissociation of the autoinhibitory alpha5 helix from the core activates ESCRT-III proteins for assembly at membranes."

Our observations indicated that 1) epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) and other catechin galloyl esters bound with food ingredients (i.e., proteins) to form a complex that is likely to be unabsorbable through the intestinal wall, whereas most catechins not esterified with gallic acid (GA) remain in free form, not complexing with food ingredients; 2) tannase activity of L. plantarum is strain dependent, possibly grouped into those with high tannase activity hydrolyzing EGCg to epigallocatechin and GA and those with the low activity; and 3) L. plantarum strains with high tannase activity are capable of hydrolyzing not only intact EGCg but also EGCg and other catechin galloyl esters complexed with dietary proteins to free non-galloyl ester catechins and GA. The evidence suggests that L. plantarum with high tannase activity, if it colonizes the human intestine, would release free non-galloyl-ester catechins and GA that are readily absorbed through the human intestinal epithelia from the complexes, thereby ensuring maximum delivery of the bioactive polyphenols of green tea to the host."

However, the role of butyrate in acute liver injury has not yet been fully explored. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the association between butyrate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute liver injury and the signaling pathways involved.
METHODS: LPS-induced acute liver injury was induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (5 mg/kg) in G-protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43)-knockout (KO) and wild-type female C57BL/6 mice. Sodium butyrate (500mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to LPS exposure. Liver injury was detected by serum markers, tissue morphology, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Pro-inflammatory-factor levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell models were first treated with sodium butyrate (4 μmol/mL), followed by LPS (1 μg/mL) half an hour later in GPR43 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected or control RAW264.7 cells. Cell-inflammation status was evaluated through detecting pro-inflammatory-factor expression by RT-PCR and also through checking toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-κB (TLR4/NF-κB)-element levels including TLR4, TRAF6, IKKβ, IкBα, phospho-IкBα, p65, and phospho-p65 by Western blot. The interaction between GPR43 and β-arrestin-2 was tested by co-immunoprecipitation.
RESULTS: Sodium butyrate reversed the LPS-induced tissue-morphology changes and high levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, myeloperoxidase, TUNEL, and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. The ameliorating effect of sodium butyrate was weakened in GPR43-KO mice and GPR43 siRNA RAW264.7 cells, compared with those of GPR43-positive controls. Sodium butyrate downregulated some elements of the TLR4/NF-κB pathway, including phospho-IκBα and phospho-p65, in RAW264.7 cells. Increased interactions between GPR43 and β-arrestin-2, and between β-arrestin-2 and IкBα were observed.
CONCLUSION: Sodium butyrate significantly attenuated LPS-induced liver injury by reducing the inflammatory response partially via the GPR43/β-arrestin-2/NF-κB signaling pathway."

Our previous research identified that quiescent adult naïve CD4+ T cells express LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear elements 1) spliced in previously unknown isoforms, and their down-regulation marks the transition to activation. Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)-mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging. Our study proposes LINE1 as a critical player of human T cell function across the human life span."

To contend with such diversity, insects have evolved a family of odorant-gated ion channels comprised of a highly conserved co-receptor (Orco) and a divergent odorant receptor (OR) that confers chemical specificity. Here, we present the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of an Orco homomer from the parasitic fig wasp Apocrypta bakeri at 3.5 Å resolution, providing structural insight into this receptor family. Orco possesses a novel channel architecture, with four subunits symmetrically arranged around a central pore that diverges into four lateral conduits that open to the cytosol. The Orco tetramer has few inter-subunit interactions within the membrane and is bound together by a small cytoplasmic anchor domain. The minimal sequence conservation among ORs maps largely to the pore and anchor domain, shedding light on how the architecture of this receptor family accommodates its remarkable sequence diversity and facilitates the evolution of odour tuning."

New light sources like the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) have enabled data collection from macromolecular crystals at ambient temperature. Here, we report an X-ray crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit decoding complex to 3.45 Å resolution using data obtained at ambient temperature at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). We find that this ambient-temperature structure is largely consistent with existing cryogenic-temperature crystal structures, with key residues of the decoding complex exhibiting similar conformations, including adenosine residues 1492 and 1493. Minor variations were observed, namely an alternate conformation of cytosine 1397 near the mRNA channel and the A-site. Our serial crystallography experiment illustrates the amenability of ribosomal microcrystals to routine structural studies at ambient temperature, thus overcoming a long-standing experimental limitation to structural studies of RNA and RNA-protein complexes at near-physiological temperatures."

Additionally, we show that ligand binding to σ<sub>1</sub> is a multistep process that is rate limited by receptor conformational change. We used MD simulations to reconstruct a ligand binding pathway involving two major conformational changes.

However, little is known about virus-transposon interactions within host cells. Here, we discover a strategy where human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) hijacks L1 retrotransposon encoded protein during its replication cycle. HCMV infection upregulates L1 expression by enhancing both the expression of L1-activating transcription factors, YY1 and RUNX3, and the chromatin accessibility of L1 promoter regions. Increased L1 expression, in turn, promotes HCMV replicative fitness. Affinity proteomics reveals UL44, HCMV DNA polymerase subunit, as the most abundant viral binding protein of the L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. UL44 directly interacts with L1 ORF2p, inducing DNA damage responses in replicating HCMV compartments. While increased L1-induced mutagenesis is not observed in HCMV for genetic adaptation, the interplay between UL44 and ORF2p accelerates viral DNA replication by alleviating replication stress. Our findings shed light on how HCMV exploits host retrotransposons for enhanced viral fitness."

Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is the major TE class, which occupies nearly 20% of the mouse genome. L1 is highly active in mammalian preimplantation embryos, posing a major threat to genome integrity, but the mechanism of stage-specific protection against L1 retrotransposition is unknown. Here, we show that TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), mutations in which constitute a major risk factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, inhibits L1 retrotransposition in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and preimplantation embryos. Knockdown of TDP-43 resulted in massive genomic L1 expansion and impaired cell growth in preimplantation embryos and ESCs. Functional analysis demonstrated that TDP-43 interacts with L1 open reading frame 1 protein (L1 ORF1p) to mediate genomic protection, and loss of this interaction led to derepression of L1 retrotransposition. Our results identify TDP-43 as a guardian of the embryonic genome."

Abnormal processing of the single transmembrane-spanning C99 fragment of APP contributes to the formation of amyloid plaques, which are causally related to AD. Pathological C99 accumulation is thought to associate with early cognitive defects in AD. Here, unexpectedly, sequence analysis revealed that C99 exhibits 24% sequence identity with the KCNE1 voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel β subunit, comparable to the identity between KCNE1 and KCNE2-5 (21-30%). This suggested the possibility of C99 regulating Kv channels.
METHODS: We quantified the effects of C99 on Kv channel function, using electrophysiological analysis of subunits expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, biochemical and immunofluorescence techniques.
RESULTS: C99 isoform-selectively inhibited (by 30-80%) activity of a range of Kv channels. Among the KCNQ (Kv7) family, C99 isoform-selectively inhibited, shifted the voltage dependence and/or slowed activation of KCNQ2, KCNQ3, KCNQ2/3 and KCNQ5, with no effects on KCNQ1, KCNQ1-KCNE1 or KCNQ4. C99/APP co-localized with KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in adult rat sciatic nerve nodes of Ranvier. Both C99 and full-length APP co-immunoprecipitated with KCNQ2 in vitro, yet unlike C99, APP only weakly affected KCNQ2/3 activity. Finally, C99 altered the effects on KCNQ2/3 function of inhibitors tetraethylammounium and XE991, but not openers retigabine and ICA27243.
CONCLUSION: Our findings raise the possibility of C99 accumulation early in AD altering cellular excitability by modulating Kv channel activity."

To elucidate the biological significance of PODXL and its molecular mechanism in gastric cancer (GC), we investigated the expression of PODXL in GC samples and assessed its effects on biological behaviors and the related signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the possible and closely interacted partners of PODXL were identified. Our data showed that the protein or mRNA level of PODXL was significantly upregulated in tissues or serum of GC patients compared with normal-appearing tissues (NAT) or those of healthy volunteers. Overall survival (OS) curves showed that patients with high PODXL levels in tissues or serum had a worse 5-year OS. In vitro, restoring PODXL expression promoted tumor progression by increasing cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing, migration and invasion, as well as suppressing the apoptosis. Furthermore, the PI3K/AKT, NF-κB and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways were activated. There was a significant positive correlation between PODXL and RUN and FYVE domain containing 1 (RUFY1) expression in tissues or serum. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis, co-immunoprecipitation assays and western blot analysis identified PODXL/RUFY1 complexes in GC cells, and silencing RUFY1 expression in GC cells significantly attenuated PODXL-induced phenotypes and their underlying signaling pathways. Our results suggested that PODXL promoted GC progression via a RUFY1-dependent signaling mechanism. New GC therapeutic opportunities through PODXL and targeting the PODXL/RUFY1 complex might improve cancer therapy."

It catalyzes the removal of mRNA poly(A) tails, thereby repressing translation and committing mRNAs to decay. The conserved core of the complex consists of a catalytic module comprising two deadenylases (CAF1/POP2 and CCR4a/b) and the NOT module, which contains at least NOT1, NOT2 and NOT3. NOT1 bridges the interaction between the two modules and therefore, acts as a scaffold protein for the assembly of the complex. Here, we present the crystal structures of the CAF1-binding domain of human NOT1 alone and in complex with CAF1. The NOT1 domain comprises five helical hairpins that adopt an MIF4G (middle portion of eIF4G) fold. This NOT1 MIF4G domain binds CAF1 through a pre-formed interface and leaves the CAF1 catalytic site fully accessible to RNA substrates. The conservation of critical structural and interface residues suggests that the NOT1 MIF4G domain adopts a similar fold and interacts with CAF1 in a similar manner in all eukaryotes. Our findings shed light on the assembly of the CCR4-NOT complex and provide the basis for dissecting the role of the NOT module in mRNA deadenylation."

Yet, the mechanism by which TGFβ enables T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation remains elusive. Here we reveal that TGFβ enables T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation by reversing SKI-SMAD4-mediated suppression of the expression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt). We found that, unlike wild-type T cells, SMAD4-deficient T cells differentiate into T<sub>H</sub>17 cells in the absence of TGFβ signalling in a RORγt-dependent manner. Ectopic SMAD4 expression suppresses RORγt expression and T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation of SMAD4-deficient T cells. However, TGFβ neutralizes SMAD4-mediated suppression without affecting SMAD4 binding to the Rorc locus. Proteomic analysis revealed that SMAD4 interacts with SKI, a transcriptional repressor that is degraded upon TGFβ stimulation. SKI controls histone acetylation and deacetylation of the Rorc locus and T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation via SMAD4: ectopic SKI expression inhibits H3K9 acetylation of the Rorc locus, Rorc expression, and T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation in a SMAD4-dependent manner.

MC1568 arrests myogenesis by (i) decreasing myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, (ii) by stabilizing the HDAC4-HDAC3-MEF2D complex, and (iii) paradoxically, by inhibiting differentiation-induced MEF2D acetylation. In vivo MC1568 shows an apparent tissue-selective HDAC inhibition. In skeletal muscle and heart, MC1568 inhibits the activity of HDAC4 and HDAC5 without affecting HDAC3 activity, thereby leaving MEF2-HDAC complexes in a repressed state.

They are also attractive targets for the development of new antibiotics. YsxC is a member of a family of GTPases highly conserved across eubacteria with a possible ribosome associated function.
RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate by the creation of a conditional lethal mutant that ysxC is apparently essential for growth in S. aureus. To begin to elucidate YsxC function, a translational fusion of YsxC to the CBP-ProteinA tag in the staphylococcal chromosome was made, enabling Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) of YsxC-interacting partners. These included the ribosomal proteins S2, S10 and L17, as well as the beta' subunit of the RNA polymerase. YsxC was then shown to copurify with ribosomes as an accessory protein specifically localizing to the 50 S subunit. YsxC depletion led to a decrease in the presence of mature ribosomes, indicating a role in ribosome assembly and/or stability in S. aureus.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrate that YsxC of S. aureus localizes to the ribosomes, is crucial for ribosomal stability and is apparently essential for the life of S. aureus."

S100A12 is an important factor in host/parasite defenses and in the inflammatory response. Like several other S100 proteins, it binds zinc and copper in addition to calcium. Mechanisms of zinc regulation have been proposed for a number of S100 proteins e.g. S100B, S100A2, S100A7, S100A8/9. The interaction of S100 proteins with their targets is strongly dependent on cellular microenvironment.
RESULTS: The aim of the study was to explore the factors that influence S100A12 oligomerization and target interaction. A comprehensive series of biochemical and biophysical experiments indicated that changes in the concentration of calcium and zinc led to changes in the oligomeric state of S100A12. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed that the presence of both calcium and zinc is essential for the interaction of S100A12 with one of its extracellular targets, RAGE--the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products. By using a single-molecule approach we have shown that the presence of zinc in tissue culture medium favors both the oligomerization of exogenous S100A12 protein and its interaction with targets on the cell surface.
CONCLUSION: We have shown that oligomerization and target recognition by S100A12 is regulated by both zinc and calcium. Our present work highlighted the potential role of calcium-binding S100 proteins in zinc metabolism and, in particular, the role of S100A12 in the cross talk between zinc and calcium in cell signaling."

Here, we elucidate the components and mechanisms driving a protein-directed RNA switch in the 3'UTR of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. We describe a novel HILDA (hypoxia-inducible hnRNP L-DRBP76-hnRNP A2/B1) complex that coordinates a three-element RNA switch, enabling VEGFA mRNA translation during combined hypoxia and inflammation. In addition to binding the CA-rich element (CARE), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L regulates switch assembly and function. hnRNP L undergoes two previously unrecognized, condition-dependent posttranslational modifications: IFN-γ induces prolyl hydroxylation and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasomal degradation, whereas hypoxia stimulates hnRNP L phosphorylation at Tyr(359), inducing binding to hnRNP A2/B1, which stabilizes the protein. Also, phospho-hnRNP L recruits DRBP76 (double-stranded RNA binding protein 76) to the 3'UTR, where it binds an adjacent AU-rich stem-loop (AUSL) element, ""flipping"" the RNA switch by disrupting the GAIT (interferon-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) element, preventing GAIT complex binding, and driving robust VEGFA mRNA translation. The signal-dependent, HILDA complex coordinates the function of a trio of neighboring RNA elements, thereby regulating translation of VEGFA and potentially other mRNA targets. The VEGFA RNA switch might function to ensure appropriate angiogenesis and tissue oxygenation during conflicting signals from combined inflammation and hypoxia. We propose the VEGFA RNA switch as an archetype for signal-activated, protein-directed, multi-element RNA switches that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression in complex environments."

BACKGROUND: Previous studies with platelets identified factors affecting RAP1B activity but regulatory miRNAs that affect RAP1B protein expression have not been reported.
OBJECTIVE: To understand the functional significance of miRNA mediated regulation of RAP1B in stored platelets, using microRNA, miR-181a as an example.
METHODS: A Tagged RNA Affinity approach (MS2-TRAP) was employed to identify miRNAs that bound to the 3` untranslated region (3`UTR) of the RAP1B mRNA in HeLa cells as an assay system. And subsequently, the mRNA 3'UTR:miRNA interactions were verified in platelets through the ectopic expression of miR-181a mimic and appropriate controls. The interaction of such miRNAs with RAP1B mRNA was also validated by qRT-PCR and Western analysis.
RESULTS: Sixty-two miRNAs from MS2 assay were then compared with already known 171 platelet abundant miRNAs to identify a common set of miRNAs. This analysis yielded six miRNAs (miR- 30e, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-206, miR-208a and miR-454), which are also predicted to target RAP1B mRNA. From this pool, miR-181a was selected for further study since RAP1B harbors two binding sites for miR-181a in its 3'UTR. Ectopic expression of miR-181a mimic in platelets resulted in lowering the endogenous RAP1B at both mRNA and protein levels. Further, miR-181a ectopic expression reduced the surface expression of the platelet activation marker, P-selectin.
CONCLUSION: MicroRNA-181a can target RAP1B and this interaction has the potential to regulate platelet activation during storage."

ORF2p reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease activities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer2,3, autoimmunity4,5 and ageing6,7, making ORF2p a potential therapeutic target. However, a lack of structural and mechanistic knowledge has hampered efforts to rationally exploit it. We report structures of the human ORF2p 'core' (residues 238-1061, including the RT domain) by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy in several conformational states. Our analyses identified two previously undescribed folded domains, extensive contacts to RNA templates and associated adaptations that contribute to unique aspects of the L1 replication cycle. Computed integrative structural models of full-length ORF2p show a dynamic closed-ring conformation that appears to open during retrotransposition. We characterize ORF2p RT inhibition and reveal its underlying structural basis. Imaging and biochemistry show that non-canonical cytosolic ORF2p RT activity can produce RNA:DNA hybrids, activating innate immune signalling through cGAS/STING and resulting in interferon production6-8. In contrast to retroviral RTs, L1 RT is efficiently primed by short RNAs and hairpins, which probably explains cytosolic priming. Other biochemical activities including processivity, DNA-directed polymerization, non-templated base addition and template switching together allow us to propose a revised L1 insertion model. Finally, our evolutionary analysis demonstrates structural conservation between ORF2p and other RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases. We therefore provide key mechanistic insights into L1 polymerization and insertion, shed light on the evolutionary history of L1 and enable rational drug development targeting L1."

We recently reported that human MOV10 recruits DCP2 to decap LINE-1 RNA by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), resulting in the inhibition of LINE-1 retrotransposition, while the detailed mechanism still awaits further exploration. In this report, we found that the extended motif II (563-675aa) and the C-terminal domain (907-1003aa) of MOV10 cooperated to achieve maximal inhibition on LINE-1 retrotransposition. The extended motif II involves the interaction between MOV10 and LINE-1, and the C-terminal domain is required for MOV10's association with G3BP1 and thereby the formation of granules. The association with LINE-1 through the extended motif II is dominantly attributed to MOV10-mediated anti-LINE-1 activity. On this basis, promoting large granules formation by the C-terminal domain warrants maximal inhibition of LINE-1 replication by MOV10. These data together shed light on the detailed mechanism underlying MOV10-mediated inhibition of LINE-1 retrotransposition, and provide further evidence supporting the important role of MOV10-driven granules in the anti-LINE-1 action."

Here, we present the crystal structure of the four-MBT-repeat domain of dSfmbt in complex with a mono-methylated histone H4 peptide. Only a single histone peptide binds to the four-MBT-repeat domain. Mutational analyses show high-affinity binding with low peptide sequence selectivity through combinatorial interaction of the methyl-lysine with an aromatic cage and positively charged flanking residues with the surrounding negatively charged surface of the fourth MBT repeat. dSfmbt directly interacts with the PcG protein Scm, a related MBT-repeat protein with similar methyl-lysine binding activity. dSfmbt and Scm co-occupy Polycomb response elements of target genes in Drosophila and they strongly synergize in the repression of these target genes, suggesting that the combined action of these two MBT proteins is crucial for Polycomb silencing."

It consists of four pore-forming Kir6.2 and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. SUR2B serves as the regulatory subunit in smooth muscle and some neurones. An integrative approach, combining electron microscopy and homology modelling, has been used to obtain information on the structure of this large (megadalton) membrane protein complex. Single-particle electron microscopy of purified SUR2B tethered to a lipid monolayer revealed that it assembles as a tetramer of four SUR2B subunits surrounding a central hole. In the absence of an X-ray structure, a homology model for SUR2B based on the X-ray structure of the related ABC transporter Sav1866 was used to fit the experimental images. The model indicates that the central hole can readily accommodate the transmembrane domains of the Kir tetramer, suggests a location for the first transmembrane domains of SUR2B (which are absent in Sav1866) and suggests the relative orientation of the SUR and Kir6.2 subunits."

However, genetic interactions between L1 and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that HIV-1 suppresses L1 retrotransposition. Notably, HIV-1 Vpr strongly inhibited retrotransposition without inhibiting L1 promoter activity. Since Vpr is known to regulate host cell cycle, we examined the possibility whether Vpr suppresses L1 retrotransposition in a cell cycle dependent manner. We showed that the inhibitory effect of a mutant Vpr (H71R), which is unable to arrest the cell cycle, was significantly relieved compared with that of wild-type Vpr, suggesting that Vpr suppresses L1 mobility in a cell cycle dependent manner. Furthermore, a host cell cycle regulator p21Waf1 strongly suppressed L1 retrotransposition. The N-terminal kinase inhibitory domain (KID) of p21 was required for this inhibitory effect. Another KID-containing host cell cycle regulator p27Kip1 also strongly suppressed L1 retrotransposition. We showed that Vpr and p21 coimmunoprecipitated with L1 ORF2p and they suppressed the L1 reverse transcriptase activity in LEAP assay, suggesting that Vpr and p21 inhibit ORF2p-mediated reverse transcription. Altogether, our results suggest that viral and host cell cycle regulatory machinery limit L1 mobility in cultured cells."

The L1 mRNA encodes two proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both essential for retrotransposition. ORF2p has reverse transcriptase and endonuclease activities, while ORF1p is a homotrimeric RNA-binding protein with poorly understood function. Here, we show that condensation of ORF1p is critical for L1 retrotransposition. Using a combination of biochemical reconstitution and live-cell imaging, we demonstrate that electrostatic interactions and trimer conformational dynamics together tune the properties of ORF1p assemblies to allow for efficient L1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex formation in cells. Furthermore, we relate the dynamics of ORF1p assembly and RNP condensate material properties to the ability to complete the entire retrotransposon life-cycle. Mutations that prevented ORF1p condensation led to loss of retrotransposition activity, while orthogonal restoration of coiled-coil conformational flexibility rescued both condensation and retrotransposition. Based on these observations, we propose that dynamic ORF1p oligomerization on L1 RNA drives the formation of an L1 RNP condensate that is essential for retrotransposition."

Although animals have evolved robust TE-targeting defenses, including Piwi-interacting (pi)RNAs, retrotransposon LINE-1 (L1) still thrives in humans and mice. To gain insights into L1 endurance, we characterized L1 Bodies (LBs) and ORF1p complexes in germ cells of piRNA-deficient Maelstrom null mice. We report that ORF1p interacts with TE RNAs, genic mRNAs, and stress granule proteins, consistent with earlier studies. We also show that ORF1p associates with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex and PRKRA, a Protein Kinase R factor. Despite ORF1p interactions with these negative regulators of RNA expression, the stability and translation of LB-localized mRNAs remain unchanged. To scrutinize these findings, we studied the effects of PRKRA on L1 in cultured cells and showed that it elevates ORF1p levels and L1 retrotransposition. These results suggest that ORF1p-driven condensates promote L1 propagation, without affecting the metabolism of endogenous RNAs."

Here, we introduce the native holdup (nHU) approach to estimate equilibrium binding constants of protein interactions directly from cell extracts. Compared to other pull-down-based assays, nHU requires less sample preparation and can be coupled to any analytical methods as readouts, such as Western blotting or mass spectrometry. We use nHU to explore interactions of SNX27, a cargo adaptor of the retromer complex and find good agreement between in vitro affinities and those measured directly from cell extracts using nHU. We discuss the strengths and limitations of nHU and provide simple protocols that can be implemented in most laboratories."

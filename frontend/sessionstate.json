Open and shut time distributions exhibited two and five components, respectively; ethanol selectively decreased the time constant and relative proportion of the longer open time component. In the GluN2A subunit, ethanol increased the time constants of all but the longest shut time components, whereas in the GluN2B subunit, shut times were unchanged by ethanol. Fitting of bursts of openings (representing individual activations of the receptor) to the gating portion of a kinetic model revealed that ethanol altered two rates: the rate associated with activation of the GluN2A or GluN2B subunit, and the rate associated with closing of the longer of the two open states."

A large body of evidence supports an important role for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ion channel in mediating alcohol action in the brain, both in acute intoxication, as well as in phenomena including alcohol craving, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and relapse. Although alcohol can modulate NMDA receptor sensitivity and signaling via multiple mechanisms, its direct action on NMDA receptors involves altering ion channel gating via an interaction with specific modulatory sites."

These studies established that ethanol inhibition involves modulation of gating, but were performed prior to the development of accurate models of ion channel gating, so the precise effects of ethanol on the transitions among the different kinetic states that constitute NMDAR gating behavior have not been determined. In addition, the studies of and were performed in native CNS neurons in culture. While the conditions used in these studies should closely approximate NMDA receptor modulation by ethanol in vivo, the subunit composition of the receptors tested in these studies is unknown, and most likely was a varying mixture of GluN1/GluN2A, GluN1/GluN2B, and GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B heterotrimeric NMDA receptors. In the present study, we used single-channel recording in recombinant GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors expressed in the HEK-293 cell line. Using low agonist concentrations to allow separation of groups of opening events into bursts representing individual activations of the receptor, we fit the data to the gating portion of a cyclic model to determine the kinetic effects of ethanol on NMDA receptor gating. Under these conditions, the effect of ethanol was primarily attributable to alteration of two specific ion channel gating rate constants in the kinetic model in both subunit types."

      "text": "A distinct separation was evident in the shut time distributions between the third and fourth components in GluN2A subunit-containing receptors and between the fourth and fifth components in GluN2B subunit-containing receptors. In the GluN2A subunit, the shortest three shut times are considered to occur within an individual activation of the receptor-ion channel. Of the longest two shut times, one represents a long-lived desensitized state (within an activation), and one the agonist-unbound state (between activations). Although there is evidence from some studies that ethanol may influence NMDAR desensitization, the absence of a change in the closed time corresponding to the desensitized state in the presence of ethanol is consistent with a negligible effect under the conditions used in this study. In the GluN2B subunit, the longest two shut times are considered to differentiate individual activations of the receptor-ion channel. To determine the effects of ethanol on gating transitions in the fully-liganded, non-desensitized receptor, we grouped opening events into bursts that should correspond to individual activations of the receptor by choosing values of \u03c4crit between the third and fourth (GluN2A) or fourth and fifth (GluN2B) shut time components (Fig 5, arrows). Values of \u03c4crit determined for patches in the absence and presence of ethanol were 10.7 and 8.9 ms, respectively for GluN2A and 83.3 and 151 ms, respectively for GluN2B. We extracted bursts from the idealized data record such that closed times longer than the \u03c4crit value were not included in the analysis. Maximal interval likelihood fitting of bursts to scheme 1 of, a cyclic model that does not incorporate agonist binding and unbinding steps or desensitized states (Fig. 6), yielded values for the rate constants that in general were similar to those previously determined (Table 2). In both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, ethanol selectively altered two of the kinetic transitions: it decreased the rate constant for the slow forward rate, ks+, by 28.4 % (paired t-test, P < 0.0005) in GluN2A and by 30.2 % (paired t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2B, and increased the reverse rate between open states, o\u2212, by 49.8 % (t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2A and 31 % (t-test, P < 0.05) in GluN2B. The remaining kinetic values were not appreciably altered by ethanol (mean change: 8.0 percent; t-tests, P > 0.05). To test whether the two changed rate constants could account for the observed decreases in mean open time and open probability due to ethanol, we substituted these rates in the model and generated simulated current traces using the QUB program, leaving all other rates unchanged from their control values. Changing the slow forward rate, ks+, and the open state reverse rate, o\u2212, to their values in the presence of ethanol accounted for 91% and 90% of the inhibitory effect of ethanol on open probability in the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, respectively."

      "text": "Following the initial demonstrations that ethanol inhibits NMDA receptor activity, a few studies used single-channel recording to examine the alterations in receptor kinetics responsible for the inhibitory effect. In the earliest such study, reported that ethanol (86.5 and 174 mM) decreased NMDAR mean open time in outside-out patches from rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons without altering single-channel conductance. These investigators observed a decrease in open probability of approximately 50%, but did not report values for opening frequency. subsequently showed that in outside-out patches from mouse cerebral cortical neurons, ethanol (200 mM) decreased both mean open time and frequency of opening without altering single-channel conductance or shut times, and without introducing fast flickering behavior. The reduction in mean open time was greater than that in frequency of opening, but both were required to account for the observed reduction in whole-cell current by ethanol. In the present study, at a concentration similar to those used previously, but in recombinant rat GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors expressed in a cultured cell line rather than in native CNS neurons, we observed similar effects of ethanol: the main effect was to decrease mean open time of the ion channel without altering single channel conductance. There was also no difference in closed time distributions, including no introduction of very short closed times, or fast flickering behavior. Because either an increase in very short closed times or reduced single-channel conductance could indicate an open-channel block mechanism, the absence of either finding has been interpreted as evidence that ethanol does not act by occluding the ion channel. The observation that ethanol primarily shortens mean open time is consistent with a mechanism of inhibition involving an increase in the rate of ion channel closing."

      "text": "Previous studies have reported that magnesium ions, which normally block NMDA receptors at strongly negative potentials under physiological conditions, can enhance ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors, although this has not been observed in all studies. In the present study, experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular magnesium to avoid block at negative membrane potentials. It is thus possible that this resulted in a lesser degree of ethanol inhibition than would be observed at physiological concentrations of magnesium. In addition, because magnesium alters gating kinetics (Kampa et al., 2004), it is also possible that magnesium, if it had been present, could have altered the effects of ethanol on the kinetic model. Many early studies also demonstrated glycine modulation of ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors and proposed glycine antagonism as a mechanism of inhibition; however, the binding of glycine or glutamate is not altered by ethanol, nor is ethanol inhibition competitive with respect to glycine or glutamate. In the present study we therefore excluded transitions involved in agonist or coagonist binding by fitting events occurring during bursts, which represent single activations of the ion channel, and are separated by one or two long shut times attributable to agonist dissociation and (in the GluN2A subunit) desensitization. Thus we attempted to model the effect of ethanol on gating of the fully-liganded, non-desensitized receptor. Fitting of events during bursts in the absence and presence of ethanol to a simple cyclic model using the maximum interval likelihood (MIL) function of the QUB program revealed that two rate constants in the gating section of the model were appreciably affected by ethanol in both GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B receptors: the slow forward rate, ks+, in the cyclic portion of the model was decreased, and the main open state reverse rate, o\u2212, was increased. The slow forward rate, along with the slow reverse rate, ks\u2212, has been attributed to conformational changes in the GluN2 subunit. Thus this result is consistent with ethanol acting via the GluN2 subunit, and the lack of effect of ethanol on the fast forward rate indicates that the corresponding transition in the GluN1 subunit is insensitive to ethanol, which could be due to structural differences between the subunit types underlying the much faster transitions in the GluN1 subunit. The main open state reverse rate affects the longer of the two open times, such that increasing this rate decreases the duration of the longer component. The longer open state accounts for the majority of charge transfer mediated by the NMDAR, so preferentially shortening it has a relative effect greater than would be caused by a similar change to the shorter component. Our simulations indicated that the two states that were measurably altered by ethanol accounted for the great majority of its inhibitory effect."

It should also be noted that the concentrations used in the present study are above the normal range for intoxication in humans (~20 \u2013 50 mM), although even greater concentrations than those used here may be reached in highly-tolerant individuals. Concentrations at approximate IC50 values were used in the present study to ensure that changes in individual microscopic kinetic rates, which act in concert to determine NMDA receptor gating, would be detectable. Results of many studies from this and other laboratories showing sigmoidal ethanol concentration-response curves with slopes of approximately unity are consistent with the view that lower concentrations of ethanol would have qualitatively similar effects. Available evidence supports the view that the NMDA receptor is responsible for some of the effects of intoxicating ethanol concentrations in humans. We and others have identified clusters of adjacent residues in the third and fourth membrane-associated domains of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits of the NMDA receptor that strongly regulate ethanol sensitivity, and which appear to form the sites by which ethanol inhibits the receptor under the conditions used in this study. While significant advances have been made in understanding the conformational changes that underlie ion channel gating, and available evidence is consistent with movements of the alcohol-sensitive side chains relative to each other during gating transitions, further studies will be required to determine how the ethanol molecule interacts with these domains to alter the kinetics of the conformational changes that are responsible for the rate constants that are regulated by ethanol."

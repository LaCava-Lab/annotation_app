35100360,PMC8896011,10.1093/g3journal/jkac002,ZNF146/OZF and ZNF507 target LINE-1 sequences.,"Creamer KM, Larsen EC, Lawrence JB",2022,G3 (Bethesda),12,3,,"Repetitive sequences including transposable elements and transposon-derived fragments account for nearly half of the human genome. While transposition-competent transposable elements must be repressed to maintain genomic stability, mutated and fragmented transposable elements comprising the bulk of repetitive sequences can also contribute to regulation of host gene expression and broader genome organization. Here, we analyzed published ChIP-seq data sets to identify proteins broadly enriched on transposable elements in the human genome. We show 2 of the proteins identified, C2H2 zinc finger-containing proteins ZNF146 (also known as OZF) and ZNF507, are targeted to distinct sites within LINE-1 ORF2 at thousands of locations in the genome. ZNF146 binding sites are found at old and young LINE-1 elements. In contrast, ZNF507 preferentially binds at young LINE-1 sequences correlated to sequence changes in LINE-1 elements at ZNF507's binding site. To gain further insight into ZNF146 and ZNF507 function, we disrupt their expression in HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and perform RNA sequencing, finding modest gene expression changes in cells where ZNF507 has been disrupted. We further identify a physical interaction between ZNF507 and PRMT5, suggesting ZNF507 may target arginine methylation activity to LINE-1 sequences."

ORF2p reverse transcriptase (RT) and endonuclease activities have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer2,3, autoimmunity4,5 and ageing6,7, making ORF2p a potential therapeutic target. However, a lack of structural and mechanistic knowledge has hampered efforts to rationally exploit it. We report structures of the human ORF2p 'core' (residues 238-1061, including the RT domain) by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy in several conformational states. Our analyses identified two previously undescribed folded domains, extensive contacts to RNA templates and associated adaptations that contribute to unique aspects of the L1 replication cycle. Computed integrative structural models of full-length ORF2p show a dynamic closed-ring conformation that appears to open during retrotransposition. We characterize ORF2p RT inhibition and reveal its underlying structural basis. Imaging and biochemistry show that non-canonical cytosolic ORF2p RT activity can produce RNA:DNA hybrids, activating innate immune signalling through cGAS/STING and resulting in interferon production6-8. In contrast to retroviral RTs, L1 RT is efficiently primed by short RNAs and hairpins, which probably explains cytosolic priming. Other biochemical activities including processivity, DNA-directed polymerization, non-templated base addition and template switching together allow us to propose a revised L1 insertion model. Finally, our evolutionary analysis demonstrates structural conservation between ORF2p and other RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases. We therefore provide key mechanistic insights into L1 polymerization and insertion, shed light on the evolutionary history of L1 and enable rational drug development targeting L1."

L1-encoded ORF1 and ORF2 proteins bind L1 RNAs, forming ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). These RNPs interact with diverse host proteins, some repressive and others required for the L1 lifecycle. Using differential affinity purifications, quantitative mass spectrometry, and next generation RNA sequencing, we have characterized the proteins and nucleic acids associated with distinctive, enzymatically active L1 macromolecular complexes. Among them, we describe a cytoplasmic intermediate that we hypothesize to be the canonical ORF1p/ORF2p/L1-RNA-containing RNP, and we describe a nuclear population containing ORF2p, but lacking ORF1p, which likely contains host factors participating in target-primed reverse transcription."

BC stem cells (BCSCs) have been known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of the breast and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of BC correlated with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapies that target PD-L1 have great potential and have been successful when applied to cancer treatment. However, whether PD-L1 regulates BCSC formation is unknown.METHODS: BCSCs were enriched by serum-free suspension culture. The properties of BCSCs were examined by mammosphere formation assay, CD44+/Cd24-, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay, CSC marker analysis, and mammosphere growth assay. To elucidate the functions of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), nuclear PD-L1, and RelB proteins in the stemness of BCSCs, mammosphere formation was examined using BRD4 inhibitor and degrader, PD-L1 degrader, and RelB inhibitor. The antitumor function of 3',4',7,8-tetrahydroxyflavone (THF), a specific BRD4 inhibitor, was studied through in vivo tumor model and mouse studies, and the protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB were examined in tumor model under THF treatment. RESULTS: BRD4 was upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates the stemness of BCs. The downregulation of BRD4 using BRD4 PROTAC, ARV-825, and BRD4 inhibitor, (+)-JQ1, inhibits mammosphere formation and reduces the levels of breast CSC markers (CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1), stem cell marker genes, and mammosphere growth. BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825) downregulate membrane and nuclear fractions of PD-L1 through the inhibition of PD-L1 transcript levels. The knockdown of PD-L1 inhibits mammosphere formation. Verteporfin, a PD-L1 degrader, inhibits the transcripts and protein levels of PD-L1 and downregulates the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Calcitriol, a RelB inhibitor, and the knockdown of RelB using si-RelB regulate mammosphere formation through interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. THF is a natural product and a potent selective BRD4 inhibitor, inhibits mammosphere formation, and reduces the levels of CD44+/CD24- and mammosphere growth by downregulating c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. 3',4',7,8-THF shows tumoricidal activity and increased levels of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in the murine tumor model using 4T1 and MC38 cells.CONCLUSIONS: The results show the first evidence of the essential role of the BRD4/nuclear PD-L1/RelB axis in breast CSC formation. The nuclear PD-L1 regulates RelB, and the RelB/p65 complex induces IL6 and breast CSC formation. Targeting nuclear PD-L1 represents a potential and novel tool for immunotherapies of intractable BC.

Here, we introduce the native holdup (nHU) approach to estimate equilibrium binding constants of protein interactions directly from cell extracts. Compared to other pull-down-based assays, nHU requires less sample preparation and can be coupled to any analytical methods as readouts, such as Western blotting or mass spectrometry. We use nHU to explore interactions of SNX27, a cargo adaptor of the retromer complex and find good agreement between in vitro affinities and those measured directly from cell extracts using nHU. We discuss the strengths and limitations of nHU and provide simple protocols that can be implemented in most laboratories."

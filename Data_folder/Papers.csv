Small EVs, or exosomes, can be produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania through the evolutionarily conserved ESCRT pathway, and act as effectors of virulence and drivers of pathogenesis within mammalian hosts. Techniques for the identification of EVs of non-mammalian origin, however, remain inaccurate in comparison to their well-characterized mammalian counterparts. Thus, we still lack reliable and specific markers for Leishmania-derived exosomes, which poses a significant challenge to the field.
METHODS: Herein, we utilized serial differential ultracentrifugation to separate Leishmania-derived EV populations into three distinct fractions. Nanoparticle tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy were used to validate their morphological characteristics, and bioinformatic analysis of LC-MS/MS proteomics corroborated cellular origins and function.
DISCUSSION: Proteomic data indicated potential novel proteic markers of Leishmania-derived exosomes, including proteins involved in endosomal machinery and the ESCRT pathway, as well as the parasitic phosphatase PRL-1. Further investigation is required to determine the specificity and sensitivity of these markers."

The aim of our study has been to develop and manufacture a CAR-T cell product that addresses some of the current limitations. We initially compared the phenotype of T cells from AML patients and healthy young and elderly controls. This analysis showed that T cells from AML patients displayed a predominantly effector phenotype, with increased expression of activation (CD69 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion markers (PD1 and LAG3), in contrast to the enriched memory phenotype observed in healthy donors. This differentiated and more exhausted phenotype was also observed, and corroborated by transcriptomic analyses, in CAR-T cells from AML patients engineered with an optimized CAR construct targeting CD33, resulting in a decreased in vivo antitumoral efficacy evaluated in xenograft AML models. To overcome some of these limitations we have combined CRISPR-based genome editing technologies with virus-free gene-transfer strategies using Sleeping Beauty transposons, to generate CAR-T cells depleted of HLA-I and TCR complexes (HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells) for allogeneic approaches. Our optimized protocol allows one-step generation of edited CAR-T cells that show a similar phenotypic profile to non-edited CAR-T cells, with equivalent in vitro and in vivo antitumoral efficacy. Moreover, genomic analysis of edited CAR-T cells revealed a safe integration profile of the vector, with no preferences for specific genomic regions, with highly specific editing of the HLA-I and TCR, without significant off-target sites. Finally, the production of edited CAR-T cells at a larger scale allowed the generation and selection of enough HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells that would be compatible with clinical applications. In summary, our results demonstrate that CAR-T cells from AML patients, although functional, present phenotypic and functional features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors. The combination of CRISPR technologies with transposon-based delivery strategies allows the generation of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells, compatible with allogeneic approaches, that would represent a promising option for AML treatment."

BC stem cells (BCSCs) have been known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of the breast and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of BC correlated with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapies that target PD-L1 have great potential and have been successful when applied to cancer treatment. However, whether PD-L1 regulates BCSC formation is unknown.
METHODS: BCSCs were enriched by serum-free suspension culture. The properties of BCSCs were examined by mammosphere formation assay, CD44+/Cd24-, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay, CSC marker analysis, and mammosphere growth assay. To elucidate the functions of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), nuclear PD-L1, and RelB proteins in the stemness of BCSCs, mammosphere formation was examined using BRD4 inhibitor and degrader, PD-L1 degrader, and RelB inhibitor. The antitumor function of 3',4',7,8-tetrahydroxyflavone (THF), a specific BRD4 inhibitor, was studied through in vivo tumor model and mouse studies, and the protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB were examined in tumor model under THF treatment.
RESULTS: BRD4 was upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates the stemness of BCs. The downregulation of BRD4 using BRD4 PROTAC, ARV-825, and BRD4 inhibitor, (+)-JQ1, inhibits mammosphere formation and reduces the levels of breast CSC markers (CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1), stem cell marker genes, and mammosphere growth. BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825) downregulate membrane and nuclear fractions of PD-L1 through the inhibition of PD-L1 transcript levels. The knockdown of PD-L1 inhibits mammosphere formation. Verteporfin, a PD-L1 degrader, inhibits the transcripts and protein levels of PD-L1 and downregulates the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Calcitriol, a RelB inhibitor, and the knockdown of RelB using si-RelB regulate mammosphere formation through interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. THF is a natural product and a potent selective BRD4 inhibitor, inhibits mammosphere formation, and reduces the levels of CD44+/CD24- and mammosphere growth by downregulating c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. 3',4',7,8-THF shows tumoricidal activity and increased levels of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in the murine tumor model using 4T1 and MC38 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show the first evidence of the essential role of the BRD4/nuclear PD-L1/RelB axis in breast CSC formation. The nuclear PD-L1 regulates RelB, and the RelB/p65 complex induces IL6 and breast CSC formation. Targeting nuclear PD-L1 represents a potential and novel tool for immunotherapies of intractable BC.

However, their rapid non-genomic effects and underlying mechanisms on neural activities remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the rapid non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.2 channels in cultured HEK293 cells and acute brain slices including cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses in the brain stem. We found that cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, rapidly increased Kv2.2 currents by increasing the single-channel open probability in Kv2.2-expressing HEK293 cells through activation of the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor. Bovine serum albumin-conjugated dexamethasone, a membrane-impermeable agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, could mimic the effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 channels. The cortisol-increased Kv2.2 currents were induced by activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinase, which could be inhibited by U0126, an antagonist of the ERK signaling pathway. In layer 2 cortical pyramidal neurons and the calyx of Held synapses, cortisol suppressed the action potential firing frequency during depolarization and reduced the successful rate upon high-frequency stimulation by activating Kv2.2 channels. We further examined the postsynaptic responses and found that cortisol did not affect the mEPSC and evoked EPSC, but increased the activity-dependent synaptic depression induced by a high-frequency stimulus train. In conclusion, glucocorticoids can rapidly activate Kv2.2 channels through membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suppress presynaptic action potential firing, and inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity. This may be a universal mechanism of the glucocorticoid-induced non-genomic effects in the central nervous system."

While thermosensitivity in biological networks is well-explored, the effect of temperature on complex mechanochemical assemblies, like the spindle, is rarely studied. We examined fission yeast spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation from 15⁰C to 40⁰C. Our findings reveal that these parameters follow U-shaped temperature-dependent curves but reach their minima at different temperatures. Specifically, spindle dynamics peak around 35⁰C, whereas chromosome segregation defects are minimized at 25⁰C. This suggests a scenario in which mitotic errors are tolerated to expedite rapid cell cycle progression."

The molecular stoichiometry of protein to nucleic acid is often difficult to assess, particularly by standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Here, we investigate the use of composition-gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) for quantifying binding affinity and stoichiometry for two RNA-binding proteins with their nucleic acid partners of varied sequence and length: TDP43's N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with both TG/GU-repeat ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, and CELF1's two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with (TG/UGUU/GU) repeats and an experimentally defined cognate GU-rich element (GRE). Our CG-MALS data derived from each of these interactions is consistent with expected ranges of binding affinity and stoichiometry for proteins binding to shorter nucleic acid repeats. Furthermore, we conclude that CG-MALS can be an excellent method for obtaining quantitative estimates even for high (>2) protein-nucleic acid stoichiometric ratios."

A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays to measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is frequently reported as absolute mHTT concentration based on a monomeric protein standard used to generate a standard curve. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu of different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging, and a single, recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity, indicating that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies, and that MW1-depletion not be used a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein."

Inhibitors of type 4 phosphodiesterases are potent anti-inflammatory drugs now proposed for lung disorders. The current study was undertaken to determine the effects of the prototypal phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram on alveolar development and on hyperoxia-induced lung injury.
METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Rat pups were placed under hyperoxia (FiO2>95%) or room air from birth, and received rolipram or its diluent daily until sacrifice. Mortality rate, weight gain and parameters of lung morphometry were recorded on day 10. Differential cell count and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and cytokine mRNA levels in whole lung were recorded on day 6. Rolipram diminished weight gain either under air or hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induced huge mortality rate reaching 70% at day 10, which was prevented by rolipram. Leukocyte influx in bronchoalveolar lavage under hyperoxia was significantly diminished by rolipram. Hyperoxia increased transcript and protein levels of IL-6, MCP1, and osteopontin; rolipram inhibited the increase of these proteins. Alveolarization was impaired by hyperoxia and was not restored by rolipram. Under room air, rolipram-treated pups had significant decrease of Radial Alveolar Count.
CONCLUSIONS: Although inhibition of phosphodiesterases 4 prevented mortality and lung inflammation induced by hyperoxia, it had no effect on alveolarization impairment, which might be accounted for by the aggressiveness of the model. The less complex structure of immature lungs of rolipram-treated pups as compared with diluent-treated pups under room air may be explained by the profound effect of PDE4 inhibition on weight gain that interfered with normal alveolarization."
19536895,2913976,10.1002/prot.22468,Molecular dynamics simulations and functional characterization of the interactions of the PAR2 ectodomain with factor VIIa.,"Zhang Q, Petersen HH, Ostergaard H, Ruf W, Olson AJ",2009,Proteins,77,3,559,"Signaling of the tissue factor-FVIIa complex regulates angiogenesis, tumor growth, and inflammation. TF-FVIIa triggers cell signaling events by cleavage of protease activated receptor (PAR2) at the Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond. The recognition of PAR2 by the FVIIa protease domain is poorly understood. We perform molecular modeling and dynamics simulations to derive the PAR2-FVIIa interactions. Docking of the PAR2 Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond to the S1 site and subsequent molecular dynamics leads to interactions of the PAR2 ectodomain with P and P' sites of the FVIIa catalytic cleft as well as to electrostatic interactions between a stably folded region of PAR2 and a cluster of basic residues remote from the catalytic cleft of FVIIa. To address the functional significance of this interaction for PAR2 cleavage, we employed two antibodies with epitopes previously mapped to this cluster of basic residues. Although these antibodies do not block the catalytic cleft, both antibodies completely abrogated PAR2 activation by TF-FVIIa. Our simulations indicate a conformation of the PAR2 ectodomain that limits the cleavage site to no more than 33 A from its membrane proximal residue. Since the active site of FVIIa in the TF-FVIIa complex is approximately 75 A above the membrane, cleavage of the folded conformation of PAR2 would require tilting of the TF-FVIIa complex toward the membrane, indicating that additional cellular factors may be required to properly align the scissile bond of PAR2 with TF-FVIIa."

The regulation of this kinase family is unknown. Mass spectrometry has permitted the identification of Ran as an interacting and regulatory protein of the VRK serine-threonine kinase activities. The stable interaction has been validated by pulldown of endogenous proteins as well as by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. The three members of the VRK family stably interact with Ran, and the interaction was not affected by the bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP. The interaction was stronger with the RanT24N that is locked in its inactive conformation and cannot bind nucleotides. None of the kinases phosphorylated Ran or RCC1. VRK1 does not directly interact with RCC1, but if Ran is present they can be isolated as a complex. The main effect of the interaction of inactive RanGDP with VRK1 is the inhibition of its kinase activity, which was detected by a reduction in VRK1 autophosphorylation and a reduction in phosphorylation of histone H3 in residues Thr-3 and Ser-10. The kinase activity inhibition can be relieved by the interaction with the constitutively active RanGTP or RanL43E, which locks Ran in its GTP-bound active conformation. In this complex, the interaction with VRK proteins does not alter the effect of its guanine exchange factor, RCC1. Ran is a novel negative regulator of nuclear VRK1 and VRK2 kinase activity, which may vary in different subcellular localizations generating an asymmetric intracellular distribution of kinase activity depending on local protein interactions."

In one approach, metal-based fluorescent sensors for the detection of NO in living cells are evaluated, and a sensor based on a copper fluorescein complex has proved to be a valuable lead compound. Sensors of this class permit identification of NO from both inducible and constitutive forms of nitric oxide synthase and facilitate investigation of different NO functions in response to external stimuli. In the other approach, we employ synthetic model complexes of iron-sulfur clusters to probe their reactivity toward nitric oxide as biomimics of the active sites of iron-sulfur proteins. Our studies reveal that NO disassembles the Fe-S clusters to form dinitrosyl iron complexes."

It's been reported that an acute decrease in ZnT8 levels impairs β cell function and Zn(++) homeostasis, which contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although ZnT8 expression has been detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), its expression profile in the retina has yet to be determined. Furthermore, the link between diabetes and ischemic retinopathy is well documented; nevertheless, the molecular mechanism(s) of such link has yet to be defined. Our aims were to; investigate the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina; address the influence of ischemia on such expression; and evaluate the influence of YC-1; (3-(50-hydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole), a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) inhibitor, on the status of ZnT8 expression. We used real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and Müller cells to evaluate the effects of ischemia/hypoxia and YC-1 on ZnT8 expression. Our data indicate that ZnT8 was strongly expressed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and nerve fiber layer (NFL), whereas the photoreceptor layer (PRL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) showed moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that retinal ischemic insult induces a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the message and protein levels, YC-1 rescues the injured retina by restoring the ZnT8 to its basal homeostatic levels in the neovascular retinas. Our data indicate that ischemic retinopathy maybe mediated by aberrant Zn(++) homeostasis caused by ZnT8 downregulation, whereas YC-1 plays a neuroprotective role against ischemic insult. Therefore, targeting ZnT8 provides a therapeutic strategy to combat neovascular eye diseases."

While extensive studies have been performed relating to molecular interactions in the endosteal niche, the mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell interaction with bone marrow endothelial cells are less well defined. Here we demonstrate that endothelial cells derived from the bone marrow supported hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to a higher degree than other endothelial or stromal cell populations. This support was dependant upon placental growth factor expression, as genetic knockdown of mRNA levels reduced the ability of endothelial cells to support hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of recovery from radiation induced myelosuppression, we demonstrate that bone marrow endothelial cells were able to augment the recovery of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. However, this effect was diminished when the same cells with reduced placental growth factor expression were administered, possibly owing to a reduced homing of the cells to the bone marrow vasculature. Our data suggest that placental growth factor elaborated from bone marrow endothelial cells mediates the regulatory effects of the vascular niche on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell physiology."

There are data showing that carbon nanotubes may be useful in initiating and maintaining cellular metabolic responses. This study shows that administration of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with nicotinamide (NA-MWCNTs) leads to significant insulin production compared with individual administration of NA, MWCNTs, and a control solution. Treatment of 1.4E7 cells for 30 minutes with NA-MWCNTs at concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 20 mg/L resulted in significantly increased insulin release (0.18 ± 0.026 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.21 ± 0.024 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.27 ± 0.028 ng/mL for 20 mg/L). Thus, compared with cells treated with NA only (0.1 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.12 ± 0.017 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.17 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 20 mg/L) we observed a significant positive effect on insulin release in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs. The results were confirmed using flow cytometry, epifluorescence microscopy combined with immunochemistry staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. In addition, using immunofluorescence microscopy techniques, we were able to demonstrate that MWCNTs enhance insulin production via the macrophage migration inhibitory factor pathway. The application and potential of NA combined with MWCNTs as an antidiabetic agent may represent the beginning of a new chapter in the nanomediated treatment of diabetes mellitus."

Previously, we found that PS/γ-secretase cleaves voltage-gated sodium channel β2-subunits (Navβ2), releases the intracellular domain of Navβ2 (β2-ICD), and thereby, increases intracellular sodium channel α-subunit Nav1.1 levels. Here, we tested whether FAD-linked PS1 mutations modulate Navβ2 cleavages and Nav1.1 levels.
OBJECTIVE: It was the aim of this study to analyze the effects of PS1-linked FAD mutations on Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 levels in neuronal cells.
METHODS: We first generated B104 rat neuroblastoma cells stably expressing Navβ2 and wild-type PS1 (wtPS1), PS1 with one of three FAD mutations (E280A, M146L or ΔE9), or PS1 with a non-FAD mutation (D333G). Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 protein and mRNA levels were then analyzed by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: The FAD-linked E280A mutation significantly decreased PS/γ-secretase-mediated processing of Navβ2 as compared to wtPS1 controls, both in cells and in a cell-free system. Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the surface levels of Nav channel α-subunits, were also significantly reduced in PS1(E280A) cells.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the FAD-linked PS1(E280A) mutation decreases Nav channel levels by partially inhibiting the PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Navβ2 in neuronal cells."

In this study, we investigated whether the glial water channel Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is involved in the hypoxia-dependent VEGF upregulation in the retina of a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). The expression levels of VEGF, the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the production of nitric oxide (NO), the methylation status of the HIF-1 binding site (HBS) in the VEGF gene promoter, the binding of HIF-1α to the HBS, the retinal vascularization and function have been determined in the retina of wild-type (WT) and AQP4 knock out (KO) mice under hypoxic (OIR) or normoxic conditions. In response to 5 days of hypoxia, WT mice were characterized by (i) AQP4 upregulation, (ii) increased levels of VEGF, HIF-1α, iNOS and NO, (iii) pathological angiogenesis as determined by engorged retinal tufts and (iv) dysfunctional electroretinogram (ERG). AQP4 deletion prevents VEGF, iNOS and NO upregulation in response to hypoxia thus leading to reduced retinal damage although in the presence of high levels of HIF-1α. In AQP4 KO mice, HBS demethylation in response to the beginning of hypoxia is lower than in WT mice reducing the binding of HIF-1α to the VEGF gene promoter. We conclude that in the absence of AQP4, an impaired HBS demethylation prevents HIF-1 binding to the VEGF gene promoter and the relative VEGF transactivation, reducing the VEGF-induced retinal damage in response to hypoxia."

Cellular apoptosis was quantified in multiple environments ranging from 2D flat and 3D spheroid cell culture systems to in vivo murine mammary tumor xenografts. We evaluated cell-by-cell apoptotic responses to multiple pharmacological and genetic methods of interest involved in cancer cell death. Within this article, we describe methods for measuring caspase-3 activation at single-cell resolution in various complex environments using FLIM."

The structures of the isolated compounds were determined based on analysis of NMR and MS data, as well as comparison with the literature. The hypoglycemic activity of crude extracts and isolated compounds was assessed by the ability to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. The hexane extract showed weak inhibitory activity on α-amylase, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 625 µg·mL-1, while the other extracts and isolated compounds were inactive at the maximum dose tested. The results on α-glucosidase showed more favorable effects; the hexanic and methanolic extracts exhibited a strong inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 48.22 µg·mL-1 and 19.22 µg·mL-1, respectively. Four of the nine isolated compounds exhibited strong inhibitory activity with IC<sub>50</sub> values below 8 µM, much higher than acarbose (377 uM). Linoleic acid was the most potent compound (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.42 µM) followed by afzelin, (+)-catechin and quercitrin."

Bipolaris maydis is a non-adapted pathogen affecting soybeans, particularly of maize/soybean intercropping systems. However, no experimental evidence has described the immune response of soybeans against B. maydis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying NHR in soybeans, proteomics analysis based on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed to identify proteins involved in the soybean response to B. maydis. The spread of B. maydis spores across soybean leaves induced NHR throughout the plant, which mobilized almost all organelles and various metabolic processes in response to B. maydis. Some enzymes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), oxygen evolving enhancer (OEE), and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDKs), were found to be related to NHR in soybeans. These enzymes have been identified in previous studies, and STRING analysis showed that most of the protein functions related to major metabolic processes were induced as a response to B. maydis, which suggested an array of complex interactions between soybeans and B. maydis. These findings suggest a systematic NHR against non-adapted pathogens in soybeans. This response was characterized by an overlap between metabolic processes and response to stimulus. Several metabolic processes provide the soybean with innate immunity to the non-adapted pathogen, B. maydis. This research investigation on NHR in soybeans may foster a better understanding of plant innate immunity, as well as the interactions between plant and non-adapted pathogens in intercropping systems."

No vaccine or effective antiviral therapy currently exists to control RSV or HMPV infections. During viral genome replication and transcription, the tetrameric phosphoprotein P serves as a crucial adaptor between the ribonucleoprotein template and the L protein, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase and cap-specific methyltransferase activities2,3. How P interacts with L and mediates the association with the free form of N and with the ribonucleoprotein is not clear for HMPV or other major human pathogens, including the viruses that cause measles, Ebola and rabies. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction that shows the ring-shaped structure of the polymerase and capping domains of HMPV-L bound to a tetramer of P. The connector and methyltransferase domains of L are mobile with respect to the core. The putative priming loop that is important for the initiation of RNA synthesis is fully retracted, which leaves space in the active-site cavity for RNA elongation. P interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L, burying more than 4,016 Å2 of the molecular surface area in the interface. Two of the four helices that form the coiled-coil tetramerization domain of P, and long C-terminal extensions projecting from these two helices, wrap around the L protein in a manner similar to tentacles. The structural versatility of the four P protomers-which are largely disordered in their free state-demonstrates an example of a 'folding-upon-partner-binding' mechanism for carrying out P adaptor functions. The structure shows that P has the potential to modulate multiple functions of L and these results should accelerate the design of specific antiviral drugs."

In this study, an easy-to-use strip test to detect receptor binding specificity of influenza virus was developed. A biotinylated anti-hemagglutinin antibody that bound a broad range of group 1 influenza A viruses and latex-conjugated α2,3 (blue) and α2,6 (red) sialylglycopolymers were used in an immunochromatographic strip test, with avidin and lectin immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane at test and control lines, respectively. Accumulation of a sialylglycopolymer-virus-antibody complex at the test line was visualized by eye. The strip test could be completed in 30min and did not require special equipment or skills, thereby avoiding some disadvantages of current methods for analyzing receptor binding specificity of influenza virus. The strip test could detect the receptor binding specificity of a wide range of influenza viruses, as well as small increases in the binding affinity of variant H5N1 viruses to α2,6 sialylglycans at viral titers >128 hemagglutination units. The strip test results were in agreement with those of ELISA virus binding assays, with correlations >0.95.

Recent studies showed that aberrant trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) level was associated with cell apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra via histone methyltransferase (HMT) mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) mediated epigenetic pathway. Mouse IS model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mouse primary cortical mixed cells were cultured and treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate IS process. The expressions of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/serine-threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP)/14-3-3 complex, ASK-1/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) complex, and MLL1 in mouse brain tissue and mouse primary cortical mixed cells were analyzed. The function of MLL1 was investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MLL1 and vector overexpressing MLL1. In vivo inhibition of MLL1 was conducted to explore its value as a therapeutic target. The prognostic value of MLL1 was investigated in IS patients. Results showed that the expressions of ASK-1, pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra compared to brain tissue from the control group (P &lt; 0.05). MCAO and OGD significantly upregulated the H3K4me3 level in ASK-1 promoter region and promoted the recruitment of MLL1 to this region (P &lt; 0.05). siMLL1 significantly reversed the proapoptosis effects of OGD in primary cortical mixed cells, while MLL1 overexpression induced apoptosis of cells (P &lt; 0.05). In vivo inhibition of MLL1 significantly reduced the infarct volume and the neurological score of MCAO mice (P &lt; 0.05). Serum MLL1 level had a positive association with that in ischemic core and penumbra in mouse model and was positively correlated with the infarct volume and neurological score (P &lt; 0.05). Besides, serum MLL1 level was also significantly correlated with the severity of IS (P &lt; 0.05), and high serum MLL1 level indicated poor prognosis of IS patients (P &lt; 0.05). These results revealed that MLL1 contributed to neuron cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbra after IS onset by promoting the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and its serum level was associated with poor prognosis of IS."

Here, we used a natural product-inspired drug discovery approach to identify new compounds that phenotypically mimic the anti-CSC activity of oleacein. We coupled 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship-based virtual profiling with phenotypic analysis using 3D tumorsphere formation as a gold standard for assessing the presence of CSC. Among the top 20 computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics, four fulfilled the phenotypic endpoint of specifically suppressing the tumorsphere-initiating capacity of CSC, in the absence of significant cytotoxicity against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D cultures in the same low micromolar concentration range. Of these, 3,4-dihydrophenetyl butyrate -a lipophilic ester conjugate of the hydroxytyrosol moiety of oleacein- and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide) -an inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi triosephosphate isomerase- were also highly effective at significantly reducing the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like proliferating cells. Preservation of the mTOR/DNMT binding mode of oleacein was dispensable for suppression of the ALDH+-CSC functional phenotype in hydroxytyrosol-unrelated mimetics. The anti-CSC chemistry of complex EVOO phenols such as oleacein can be phenocopied through the use of mimetics capturing its physico-chemical properties."

Chromobox homolog 2 (CBX2) has been reported to be highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. It has also been established that CBX2 is upregulated in GC cell lines by searching the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biomolecular role and underlying mechanism of CBX2 in the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells. Short hairpin RNA‑CBX2 and yes‑associated protein (YAP) overexpression plasmids were constructed to regulate CBX2 and YAP expression, respectively. Additionally, the expression of certain mRNAs and proteins involved in the YAP/β‑catenin pathway and those associated with cell invasion were assessed by western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR, respectively. The cellular behaviors of MFC cells were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit‑8, colony formation wound‑healing and Transwell assays. The results of the present study revealed that increased CBX2 expression was observed in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric cells. In addition, CBX2 knockdown inhibited the nuclear cytoplasm translocation of YAP, inducing its phosphorylation, and suppressing the activation of the β‑catenin signaling pathway. The results also demonstrated that CBX2 depletion inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells by inactivating the YAP/β‑catenin pathway. It was determined that CBX2 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells by activating the YAP/β‑catenin pathway, suggesting that CBX2 is involved in the pathogenesis of GC and may represent a novel target for the clinical treatment of GC."

So far, accumulation of neutrophils and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aimed to compare circulatory levels of neutrophil secretory proteins, alpha-defensins (DEFA1), calprotectin (S100A8/A9), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations. We studied 19 healthy subjects, 63 COVID-19 patients with mild (n=32) and severe (n=31) disease, 23 asymptomatic individuals identified through contact tracing programme and 23 recovering patients (1-4 months post-disease). At the time of disease presentation, serum levels of DEFA1 were significantly higher in patients with mild (mean230 ± 17, p<0.0001) and severe (mean452 ± 46, p<0.0001) disease respectively in comparison to healthy subjects (mean113 ± 11). S100A8/A9 proteins were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (p<0.0001) irrespective of disease severity. The levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO reduced to normal in recovering patients and comparable to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, DEFA1 levels were higher in severe than mild patients in first week of onset of disease (p=0.004). Odds-ratio analysis showed that DEFA1 could act as potential biomarker in predicting disease severity (OR=11.34). In addition, levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 were significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (p=0.004 and p=0.03) respectively. The rise in DEFA1 levels was independent of secondary infections. In conclusion, our data suggest that induction of elevated levels of alpha-defensins and S100A8/A9 is associated with poor disease outcome in COVID-19 patients."

Available data on the immune responsiveness of MF patients to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and the impact of the therapy with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, are still fragmented. Here, we profile the spike-specific IgG and memory B-cell response in MF patients, treated or not with ruxolitinib, after the second and the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples were collected before vaccination, post the second and the third doses and tested for spike-specific antibodies, ACE2/RBD antibody inhibition binding activity and spike-specific B cells. The third vaccine dose significantly increased the spike-specific IgG titers in both ruxolitinib-treated and untreated patients, and strongly enhanced the percentage of subjects with antibodies capable of in vitro blocking ACE2/RBD interaction, from 50% up to 80%. While a very low frequency of spike-specific B cells was measured in blood 7 days after the second vaccination dose, a strong and significant increase was elicited by the third dose administration, generating a B cell response similar to the one detected in healthy controls. Despite the overall positive impact of the third dose in MF patients, two patients that were under active concomitant immunosuppressive treatment at the time of vaccination, and a patient that received lymphodepleting therapies in the past, remained low responders. The third mRNA vaccine dose strongly increases the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and B cell responses in MF patients, promoting a reactivation of the immune response similar to the one observed in healthy controls."

Furthermore, MHC I expression, level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and expression of interferon (IFN) mediator MxA are positively associated with one another in human breast cancers. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of association of MHC I with ER and IFN signaling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC protein expression was analyzed in breast cancer cell lines. The expressions of HLA-A and MxA mRNAs were analyzed in MCF-7 cells in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data. ER and HLA-ABC expressions, Ki-67 labeling index and TIL levels in tumor tissue were also analyzed in ER+/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- breast cancer patients who randomly received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or estrogen modulator treatment followed by resection.
RESULTS: HLA-ABC protein expression was decreased after β-estradiol treatment or hESR-GFP transfection and increased after fulvestrant or IFN-γ treatment in cell lines. In GEO data, HLA-A and MxA expression was increased after ESR1 shRNA transfection. In patients, ER Allred score was significantly lower and the HLA-ABC expression, TIL levels, and Ki-67 were significantly higher in the estrogen modulator treated group than the chemotherapy treated group.
CONCLUSION: MHC I expression and TIL levels might be affected by ER pathway modulation and IFN treatment. Further studies elucidating the mechanism of MHC I regulation could suggest a way to boost TIL influx in cancer in a clinical setting."

Therefore, we examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one isolated from Protaetia brevitarsis larvae having antiplatelet properties and investigated different pathways that mediate the antiplatelet activity. We examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) on the regulation of phosphoproteins, thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> generation, and integrin αIIbβ3 action. Our data showed that human platelet aggregation was inhibited by 5-HI (75, 100, 150, 200 μM) without cytotoxicity, and it suppressed intracellular Ca2+ concentration through the regulation of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor I (Ser1756) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, collagen-elevated thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> production and αIIbβ3 action were inhibited by 5-HI through the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (protein kinase B).

We and others have shown that ethanol inhibition of NMDAR involves alterations in gating, especially a reduction in mean open time. However, a full description of ethanol's effects on NMDAR kinetics, including fitting them to a kinetic model, has not been reported.
METHODS: To determine ethanol's effects on NMDAR kinetics, we used steady-state single-channel recording in outside-out patches from HEK-293 cells transfected with recombinant GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDAR subunits. Very low glutamate concentrations were used to isolate individual activations of the receptor.
RESULTS: In both subunit types, ethanol, at approximate whole-cell IC<sub>50</sub> values (156 mM, GluN2A; 150 mM, GluN2B), reduced open probability (p<sub>o</sub> ) by approximately 50% and decreased mean open time without changing the frequency of opening. Open and shut time distributions exhibited two and five components, respectively; ethanol selectively decreased the time constant and relative proportion of the longer open time component. In the GluN2A subunit, ethanol increased the time constants of all but the longest shut time components, whereas in the GluN2B subunit, shut times were unchanged by ethanol. Fitting of bursts of openings (representing individual activations of the receptor) to the gating portion of a kinetic model revealed that ethanol altered two rates: the rate associated with activation of the GluN2A or GluN2B subunit, and the rate associated with the closing of the longer of the two open states.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that ethanol selectively alters individual kinetic rates and thus appears to selectively affect distinct conformational transitions involved in NMDAR gating."

Here, we analyzed published ChIP-seq data sets to identify proteins broadly enriched on transposable elements in the human genome. We show 2 of the proteins identified, C2H2 zinc finger-containing proteins ZNF146 (also known as OZF) and ZNF507, are targeted to distinct sites within LINE-1 ORF2 at thousands of locations in the genome. ZNF146 binding sites are found at old and young LINE-1 elements. In contrast, ZNF507 preferentially binds at young LINE-1 sequences correlated to sequence changes in LINE-1 elements at ZNF507's binding site. To gain further insight into ZNF146 and ZNF507 function, we disrupt their expression in HEK293 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 and perform RNA sequencing, finding modest gene expression changes in cells where ZNF507 has been disrupted.

Other biochemical activities including processivity, DNA-directed polymerization, non-templated base addition and template switching together allow us to propose a revised L1 insertion model. Finally, our evolutionary analysis demonstrates structural conservation between ORF2p and other RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerases. We therefore provide key mechanistic insights into L1 polymerization and insertion, shed light on the evolutionary history of L1 and enable rational drug development targeting L1."

L1-encoded ORF1 and ORF2 proteins bind L1 RNAs, forming ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). These RNPs interact with diverse host proteins, some repressive and others required for the L1 lifecycle. Using differential affinity purifications, quantitative mass spectrometry, and next generation RNA sequencing, we have characterized the proteins and nucleic acids associated with distinctive, enzymatically active L1 macromolecular complexes. Among them, we describe a cytoplasmic intermediate that we hypothesize to be the canonical ORF1p/ORF2p/L1-RNA-containing RNP, and we describe a nuclear population containing ORF2p, but lacking ORF1p, which likely contains host factors participating in target-primed reverse transcription."

BC stem cells (BCSCs) have been known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of the breast and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of BC correlated with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapies that target PD-L1 have great potential and have been successful when applied to cancer treatment. However, whether PD-L1 regulates BCSC formation is unknown.
METHODS: BCSCs were enriched by serum-free suspension culture. The properties of BCSCs were examined by mammosphere formation assay, CD44+/Cd24-, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay, CSC marker analysis, and mammosphere growth assay. To elucidate the functions of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), nuclear PD-L1, and RelB proteins in the stemness of BCSCs, mammosphere formation was examined using BRD4 inhibitor and degrader, PD-L1 degrader, and RelB inhibitor. The antitumor function of 3',4',7,8-tetrahydroxyflavone (THF), a specific BRD4 inhibitor, was studied through in vivo tumor model and mouse studies, and the protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB were examined in tumor model under THF treatment.
RESULTS: BRD4 was upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates the stemness of BCs. The downregulation of BRD4 using BRD4 PROTAC, ARV-825, and BRD4 inhibitor, (+)-JQ1, inhibits mammosphere formation and reduces the levels of breast CSC markers (CD44+/CD24- and ALDH1), stem cell marker genes, and mammosphere growth. BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825) downregulate membrane and nuclear fractions of PD-L1 through the inhibition of PD-L1 transcript levels. The knockdown of PD-L1 inhibits mammosphere formation. Verteporfin, a PD-L1 degrader, inhibits the transcripts and protein levels of PD-L1 and downregulates the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Calcitriol, a RelB inhibitor, and the knockdown of RelB using si-RelB regulate mammosphere formation through interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. THF is a natural product and a potent selective BRD4 inhibitor, inhibits mammosphere formation, and reduces the levels of CD44+/CD24- and mammosphere growth by downregulating c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. 3',4',7,8-THF shows tumoricidal activity and increased levels of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in the murine tumor model using 4T1 and MC38 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show the first evidence of the essential role of the BRD4/nuclear PD-L1/RelB axis in breast CSC formation. The nuclear PD-L1 regulates RelB, and the RelB/p65 complex induces IL6 and breast CSC formation. Targeting nuclear PD-L1 represents a potential and novel tool for immunotherapies of intractable BC.

Here, we introduce the native holdup (nHU) approach to estimate equilibrium binding constants of protein interactions directly from cell extracts. Compared to other pull-down-based assays, nHU requires less sample preparation and can be coupled to any analytical methods as readouts, such as Western blotting or mass spectrometry. We use nHU to explore interactions of SNX27, a cargo adaptor of the retromer complex and find good agreement between in vitro affinities and those measured directly from cell extracts using nHU. We discuss the strengths and limitations of nHU and provide simple protocols that can be implemented in most laboratories."

35100360_007,PMC8896011,INTRO,paragraph,"In the wake of whole-genome sequencing, it has become clear that only a small portion of DNA codes for protein in higher organisms. While only about 1â2% of the roughly 3 billion bases in the human genome are protein-coding, an astounding 40â50% is derived from mobile repetitive sequences collectively known as transposable elements (TEs). Mobilization of TEs, sometimes referred to as âjumping genes,â poses a threat to host genome stability and is known to sometimes cause disease (Kazazian and Moran 2017). In recent years, however, TEs and TE-derived sequences have been implicated as drivers of gene expression patterning, genome organization, development, and evolution in higher organisms (Rebollo et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2021)."
35100360_008,PMC8896011,INTRO,paragraph,"TEs multiply and spread in host genomes by âcut-and-pasteâ transposition of their DNA sequence or through an RNA intermediate (retrotransposition). Ultimately, to preserve genomic integrity TEs are largely inactivated by various mechanisms encoded by the host genome. Relatively few mobile TEs persist in the human genome, primarily consisting of a hundred or so long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1 or L1) and SVA (short interspersed nuclear elementâVNTRâAlu) repeats that require L1 encoded reverse transcriptase activity to mobilize (Brouha et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2005). Instead, most TE DNA in the genome consists of degenerate remnants of prior mobilization events that have been truncated or mutated and no longer harbor the activity necessary to âjump.â"
35100360_009,PMC8896011,INTRO,paragraph,"Transposition-competent TEs are recognized by DNA-binding proteins and generally inactivated at the level of transcription, perhaps most notably by KRAB-containing zinc finger proteins that recruit repressive epigenetic modifications to chromatin and by DNA methylation (Yang and Wang 2016; Yang et al. 2017). TEs sometimes, however, escape this repression. In humans, L1s mobilize in the germline and are a major source of inheritable structural variation between individuals (Ewing and Kazazian 2010; Mir et al. 2015). Recent studies have revealed that L1 elements are also activated in specific contexts outside of the germline, such as stress, cancer, and neural development, with disease-amplifying or functional implications (Coufal et al. 2009; Burns 2017; Faulkner and Garcia-Perez 2017; Kazazian and Moran 2017)."
35100360_010,PMC8896011,INTRO,paragraph,"Irrespective of their mobility, abundant TE sequences are nonrandomly distributed in host genomes and contribute to development and gene expression patterning through recognition by DNA-binding proteins (Manuelidis and Ward 1984; Korenberg and Rykowski 1988; Bourque et al. 2008; Rebollo et al. 2012). For instance, HERV-H/MERV-L TEs are known to be expressed early during embryogenesis and are important regulators of pluripotency and embryogenesis by regulating the expression of neighboring genes, a process driven by sequence-specific recognition of TE DNA by transcription factors (TFs) (Kigami et al. 2003; Wang et al. 2014; Robbez-Masson and Rowe 2015). L1 elements are also known to be highly expressed in the early mouse embryo and contribute to proper embryonic development (Fadloun et al. 2013;Jachowicz et al. 2017)."
35100360_011,PMC8896011,INTRO,paragraph,"While several DNA-binding proteins are known to target TEs, the complex picture of TF binding to TE sequences remains incomplete and the functional significance of these interactions on cell or organism biology is understudied, and largely unknown. Here, we analyze published ChIP-seq data sets to identify proteins that broadly recognize TE-derived sequences in the human genome. We focus on 2 poorly studied zinc finger proteins, ZNF146 (also known as OZF) and ZNF507, and characterize their recognition motifs within L1 repeats. Interestingly, we find ZNF146 is a highly conserved protein that retains targeting to thousands of relatively old L1 sequences in the genome. In contrast, ZNF507 was only observed at relatively young L1 sequences. We go on to functionally test the impact depletion of these proteins has on the transcriptome of HEK293 cells. Finally, we identify an interaction between ZNF507 and PRMT5 by co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, yielding potential insight into the function of ZNF507 in the cell."
35100360_012,PMC8896011,METHOD,title_1,Materials and methods
35100360_013,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"All TF ChIP-seq experiments with a corresponding IDR threshold peak file were downloaded from ENCODE in March 2020 (hg19 only). For each experiment, peaks were shuffled 10 times using BEDtools shuffle excluding ENCODE blacklist regions and -noOverlapping -maxTries 1000 parameters (Quinlan and Hall 2010). Frequency of intersection between experimental or shuffled peaks and Repeatmasker repeat classes were calculated using BEDtools intersect and the -u parameter. Heatmaps were graphed in R."
35100360_014,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,Meta-analysis of ChIP enrichment at LINE-1 elements was performed using unique reads (fold change over control bigwig files downloaded from ENCODE). Primary alignments were also downloaded from ENCODE and coverage files of fold change over control coverage were also generated without filtering for uniqueness using deepTools bamCoverage and the ânormalizeTo1X parameters (Ramirez et al. 2014). Meta-analysis was performed at full-length L1 elements annotated by L1Base or binned by subfamily from Repeatmasker (Penzkofer et al. 2017). Mappability tracks were downloaded from the UCSC table browser. Heatmaps were generated using deepTools computeMatrix and plotHeatmap software.
35100360_015,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,Coverage of peaks aligned to the L1PA1 consensus was performed by extracting reads (ENCODE) mapping to L1 elements using BEDtools intersect. Aligned sequences were then retrieved using BEDtools getfasta. Fasta sequences were then directly aligned to the L1PA1 consensus sequence using bwa mem and the -B 1 -O 1 -d 1 -T 1 -r 0.1 -t 12 -k 10 parameters (Li and Durbin 2009). Coverage was then calculated using Samtools depth. Signal over input was then calculated and graphed in R using ggplot2.
35100360_016,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"Motif discovery was performed on ENCODE peak DNA sequences using MEME software and order-0 background, classic discovery mode, 0 or 1 occurrence, 13mer parameters (Bailey and Elkan 1994). Motif occurrences in the genome were found using the top identified motif for each ChIP experiment and FIMO software, filtered by the indicated P-value cutoff (Grant et al. 2011)."
35100360_017,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"Protein sequences were downloaded for alignment from UniProt. L1 sequences were downloaded from Dfam. Zinc fingers were predicted and annotated using online software (http://zf.princeton.edu/, last accessed September 2021) (Persikov et al. 2009). Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX and Jalview with additional manual curation to focus on zinc finger residues and presentation."
35100360_018,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (Thermo Fisher) media and transiently transfected with equal amounts of Cas9 and sgRNA expressing plasmids (PX459) targeting either ZNF146, ZNF507 or an equivalent amount of empty vector control plasmid (Ran et al. 2013). Target sequences used for ZNF146 were 5â²-ACTGAGCATGAGCATTTTC-3â², 5â²-ACATGTACAATAAGTGATG-3â², 5â²-ACTGTAAATTCTCTGCTGGC-3â², and 5â²-TGAAGGTTTTTCCACACTC-3â². Target sequences used for ZNF507 were 5â²-TGGGCTTCAAGTTCCTCC-3â², 5â²-ATTGTTTCCGGACAAACTT-3â², 5â²-CTGGCTTCTAGATGTAATA-3â², and 5â²-AGGTTGGCTCTTGTCAACTC-3â². The day after transfection cells were selected for 36 h using puromycin before outgrowth for a total of 2 weeks prior to analysis."
35100360_019,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,Western blots were performed using antibodies against ZNF146 (Novus Biologicals) or ZNF507 (Thermo Fisher). RNA was isolated from cells disrupted with CRISPR/Cas9 in biological duplicate using Trizol RNA extraction reagent. RNA was treated with TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher) to remove contaminating DNA and cleaned up using RNeasy Mini (Qiagen) kits according to manufacturer recommendations. RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using a stand-specific kit RNA-seq kit with ribosome depletion (KAPA Biosystems) and NEBNext Adapters and Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. Paired-end 50 bp sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (UMMS Core Facilities).
35100360_020,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,Reads were pre-processed and clipped using the Fastx Toolkit and those mapping to ribosomal RNA were removed prior to subsequent mapping with Bowtie. Nonribosomal reads were then mapped to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat2 software with âlibrary-type fr-firststrand âno-coverage-search parameters and Ensembl (ver82) gene model annotations. Differential expression analysis was performed using count matrices generated by featureCounts and DeSeq2 (Liao et al. 2014). Associated graphs were generated using ggplot2 within R. The associated fastq files and count matrices for this experiment are available at GEO: GSE172285.
35100360_021,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"To express 3xFLAG-tagged ZNF507, RNA ZNF507 cDNA was amplified from HeLa cell RNA using NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix and the following oligos: 5â²-GATCGATCGGATCCGAAGAAAGTAGCAGTGTTGCCATGTTGGTG-3â² and 5â²-GATCGATCGAATTCCTAATTTGTGTTTAGAGCTGTATTGTGGTCCTTATTCAGG-3â². ZNF507 cDNA was then and cloned into a pcDNA3.1 n-terminal 3xFLAG expression vector (CMV promoter)."
35100360_022,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"For immunofluorescence analysis, HEK293 cells were grown on coverslips in 6 well dishes and transfected with pcDNA3.1-3XFLAG-ZNF507 plasmid using lipofectamine reagent (Thermo Fisher). After 36 h cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Coverslips were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) in 1% BSA, 1X PBS at 37Â°C for 1 h, then washed, and immunodetected using 1:500 dilution of conjugated secondary antibody, in 1X PBS with 1% BSA. Nuclei were visualized using Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a 100X PlanApo objective (NA 1.4) and Chroma 83000 multibandpass dichroic and emission filter set (Bratteboro). Images were captured using a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (200 series, Photometrics). Images were minimally corrected for brightness and contrast using standard practices to best represent signals observed by eye using Zen (Zeiss) software. In cells with signal, 3xFLAG-ZNF507 consistently was localized to the nucleus. No appreciable signal was observed for cells transfected with empty vector control."
35100360_023,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"Immunoprecipitation of 3xFLAG-ZNF507 and associated proteins was performed by transfecting approximately 40 million HEK293 cells with either 3x-FLAG-ZNF507 expression plasmid or an empty vector control. After 36 h, cells were dislodged from flasks in ice cold 1X PBS and harvested in 10 ml falcon tubes. Cells were washed twice in ice cold PBS before lysis for 5 min on ice in 1 ml Lysis Buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl, 0.075% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1X EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Crude nuclear pellets were then harvested by centrifugation at 4Â°C for 3 min at 1,000 Ã g and removal of supernatant. Nuclei were then suspended in 1 ml Nuclear Extraction Buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1X EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)], vortexed briefly, and incubated 15 min on ice. Insoluble DNA and debris were then cleared from the nuclear extract by centrifugation at 4Â°C for 10 min at 12,000 Ã g. To the supernatant an equal amount of Dilution buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X 100, 1 mM PMSF, 1X EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)] was added to lower salt concentration before immunoprecipitation."
35100360_024,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,"Nuclear extracts were pre-cleared by incubation with 40 Âµl Protein A dynabeads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4Â°C. After capture of beads, 40 Âµl anti-FLAG M2 magnetic beads (Sigma) were added to each nuclear extract and incubated 6 h at 4Â°C. Beads and co-immunoprecipitated proteins were then captured and washed twice for 5 min with rotation at 4Â°C with Wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and once without detergent. Proteins were eluted twice using 50 Âµl of 3X-FLAG peptide at a concentration of 500 ng/Âµl and incubated with rotation at 4Â°C for 30 min for each elution."
35100360_025,PMC8896011,METHOD,paragraph,Laemmli sample buffer (4X) was added to each elution to 1X final concentration and samples were incubated for 15 min at 80Â°C. Samples were then briefly run on the same 4%â20% Criterion Stain Free Tris-HCl Protein Gel separated by several lanes so that the dye front was 2 cm below each well. Lanes were cut out slightly above the dye to the well bottom for LC-MS/MS analysis (UMMS Mass Spectrometry Core Facility). Mascot was set up to search SwissProt_Human and Scaffold (Proteome Software Inc.) was used to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identifications.
35100360_026,PMC8896011,RESULT,title_1,Results
35100360_027,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"In order to identify proteins that broadly target TEs we developed a strategy to test chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets for enrichment on TEs using a simple peak intersection strategy (Fig. 1a). For this study, we analyzed all ENCODE transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq experiments (as of March 2020, see Supplementary Table 1) for which peaks had been identified, spanning a large number of transcription factors, cell types, and sequencing methodologies (ENCODE Project Consortium 2012;Imbeault et al. 2017). Peaks were then intersected with Repeatmasker annotated repeats for the most abundant TE classes in the human genome. Frequency of intersection between peaks for each experiment was then compared to frequency of intersection with background models generated by random shuffling to generate a ratio of observed elements relative to what would be expected by random chance (Fig. 1b)."

35100360_029,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"While most peak/TE comparisons indicated TF binding to TEs occurred less frequently than expected by random chance (Fig. 1c), 361 experiments indicated peak enrichment of greater than 2-fold (observed/expected), 267 of which were enriched for a single TE class (Fig. 1d). Interestingly, enrichment was most frequently (>100 experiments) observed for ERVK transposons. We were additionally struck with the lack of TFs identified by this approach targeting LINE-1 elements. Just 2 experiments, ChIP-seq for GFP-ZNF146 in HEK293 and GFP-ZNF507 in A529 cells demonstrated 2-fold enrichment for LINE-1 elements. This enrichment was specific for LINE-1 as these proteins were not associated with other TE classes (Fig. 1e)."
35100360_030,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"ZNF146 (also known as OZF or Only Zinc Fingers) and ZNF507 genes are both found on chromosome 19 and encode proteins with 10 and 9 C2H2 zinc finger motifs. Neither protein has any other easily identifiable domains (Fig. 1f), and apparently lack KRAB domains frequently found in zinc finger proteins known to silence TEs (Yang et al. 2017). Zinc finger motifs can contribute to proteinâprotein and proteinâRNA interactions, but are best studied for their contribution to transcription factor binding to specific DNA sequences (Laity et al. 2001). ZNF146/OZF was previously identified as being overexpressed in certain cancers (Ferbus et al. 1999,2003). Still, neither ZNF146 or ZNF507 have been extensively studied and little is known about their function despite being predicted to be widely expressed in human cells (Uhlen et al. 2015,2017)."
35100360_031,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"LINE-1 sequences are widely distributed and highly abundant in the human genome. Most L1 sequences are truncated and degenerate, with varying divergence from transposon-competent consensus sequences. There are estimated to be just 100 transposition-competent L1 elements, 4,000 mutated but full-length elements, and several hundred thousand truncated L1 fragments in the human genome (Brouha et al. 2003). Because of LINE-1 prevalence in the human genome, the small number and specificity of TFs identified by this approach, and the understudied nature of the 2 proteins identified, we decided to characterize the targeting of ZNF146 and ZNF507 to L1 elements in greater detail."
35100360_032,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"The above analyses indicated ZNF146 and ZNF507 preferentially bind to LINE-1 sequences. In order to verify these observations, we performed additional in-depth analysis of ENCODEâs ChIP-seq experiments. Consistent with L1 targeting, peaks for both ZNF146 and ZNF507 ChIP-seq experiments were found mostly (81% and 76% of peaks, respectively) within annotated L1 elements (Fig. 2a). Despite high frequency of targeting to L1 elements for both proteins, ZNF146 peaks and ZNF507 peaks themselves did not frequently coincide (Fig. 2b), suggesting they target different sequences within L1 elements."

On the right is the theoretical mappability of 100 bp reads in the same regions."
35100360_034,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"To test this idea we performed meta-analysis of ChIP-seq coverage for both proteins at full-length L1 elements (Fig. 2c). Due to their repetitive nature, full-length L1 elements are often difficult to analyze by sequencing methods, however for these experiments ENCODE performed 100 bp paired-end sequencing, allowing for relatively high mappability at disrupted (degenerate or mutated), full-length elements (Fig. 2c, left panels). In contrast, intact (retaining coding potential) L1s had very low mappability (Fig. 2c, right panels)."
35100360_035,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"Using uniquely mapping reads, concentrated enrichment of ChIP-seq signal was observed for both ZNF146 and ZNF507 at disrupted, full-length L1s, with ZNF507 enrichment most prominent toward the 5â end and ZNF146 toward the 3â end of these elements. Using primary reads (which allow for multimapping reads to be randomly assigned to 1 location), similar enrichments could be observed on intact L1 elements. Hence while it is not possible to ascertain whether ZNF146 and ZNF507 bind at individual, intact elements, these proteins likely target intact L1s as well."
35100360_036,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"We then resolved ZNF146 and ZNF507 binding by calculating coverage after performing local alignment of peak sequences to the L1PA1 (human specific) consensus sequence. LINE-1 transposons code for 2 proteins, ORF1p and ORF2p, both of which are required for transposition of LINE-1 (Moran et al. 1996). ORF1 encodes a chaperone while ORF2 encodes a reverse transcriptase essential for transposition of not only L1, but other nonautonomous TEs as well (Mathias et al. 1991;Kolosha and Martin 1997;Dewannieux et al. 2003;Ostertag et al. 2003). ZNF146 and ZNF507 peaks specifically aligned to the 3â and 5â ends of the ORF2 coding region of L1, respectively, with no enrichment within ORF1 (Fig. 2, d and e)."
35100360_037,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"We further identified likely binding motifs within L1 ORF2 by performing motif discovery (Fig. 2, f and g). The most significant motif identified for each ChIP-seq experiment closely matched sequences in the L1PA1 consensus sequence at positions of highest ChIP-seq enrichment (Fig. 2, dâg). We then located all instances of the determined motifs for ZNF146 and ZNF507 in L1 elements genome-wide and performed meta-analysis of ChIP-seq signal at these motifs. As expected, robust ChIP-seq signal was found centered around these motifs for both proteins (Fig. 2, h and i). Thus, targeting of ZNF146 and ZNF507 to L1 elements appears to be genuine and occurs at opposite ends of the ORF2 coding region."
35100360_038,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"While ChIP-seq signal enrichment was observed for ZNF146 at nearly all mappable instances of its predicted binding sites (Fig. 2h), ZNF507 ChIP-seq signal was enriched at a fraction of its motif sites, suggesting that ZNF507 may only bind to a subset of L1 elements. LINE-1 sequences in the genome have been classified based on diagnostic sequence variants. Comparative genomics and expected sequence divergence over time have further allowed for approximate aging of L1 subfamilies containing these shared sequence variants from youngest (L1PA1, human specific) to oldest (L1PA17) primate-specific LINE-1 elements (Smit et al. 1995;Khan et al. 2006;Giordano et al. 2007;Konkel et al. 2010)."
35100360_039,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"To determine whether ZNF146 or ZNF507 might differentially recognize L1 subfamilies we binned motif instances in LINE-1 elements by subfamily, and performed meta-analysis of ChIP-seq signals around these motifs. As expected from unbinned meta-analysis (Fig. 2h), ZNF146 ChIP-seq enrichment was observed at nearly all predicted mappable binding sites in all subfamilies (Fig. 3a, upper panels). Because the youngest subfamilies (L1PA1 and L1PA2) are less uniquely mappable, binding to those families could not be reliably determined. We note, however, that those families contain the same conserved binding motif and enrichment can be observed at young, intact elements when including multimapping reads (Fig. 2c), suggesting ZNF146 likely binds at these sequences as well."

35100360_041,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"In contrast, we observed strong enrichment of ZNF507 only in young subfamilies, particularly in L1PA3-L1PA8 (Fig. 3a, lower panels). Again, while binding at L1PA1 and L1PA2 sequences could not be definitively determined due to mappability, binding of ZNF507 was observed at intact L1 sequences when allowing for multimapping (Fig. 2c), suggesting ZNF507 likely binds at these elements as well. Enrichment was essentially absent or rarely observed for ZNF507 in older subfamilies, particularly PA12-PA17. L1 classifications are determined largely by 3â UTR sequence variations (as above) but are sometimes classified using upstream ORF2 sequences (L1P1, youngest, to L1P4, oldest). ZNF507 enrichment was clearly observed at motifs in L1P1, L1P2, and L1P3 subfamilies, but essentially absent at motifs in L1P4 elements (Fig. 3b). Interestingly the L1P4 consensus sequence deviates from younger subfamilies within the core motif we identified as well as 2 other nearby residues, perhaps explaining the lack of binding observed for ZNF507 at these elements (Fig. 3c)."
35100360_042,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"Zinc finger proteins and TEs are in some cases thought to have co-evolved in an âevolutionary arms raceâ of natural selection (Jacobs et al. 2014;Cosby et al. 2019). Since ZNF507 binding was observed only at young L1 subfamilies, we wondered if this specificity change could be related to amino acid substitutions in ZNF507 zinc fingers. Interestingly, multiple sequence alignment of ZNF507 ZFs revealed 3 separate residues in ZNF507 ZFs that are highly conserved among higher primates (apes and monkeys) but were not found in lower primates and other mammals (Fig. 4a). The timing of these substitutions appeared to closely parallel changes in L1 sequence and differences in ZNF507 binding (compare timeline in Fig. 4b to Fig. 3, aâc), collectively suggesting a relationship between the amino acid substitutions in ZNF507 ZFs and L1 targeting specificity."

35100360_044,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,The above results demonstrate ZNF146 and ZNF507 target thousands of L1 sequences in the genome. Binding at these regions could potentially influence L1 or endogenous gene expression. We therefore disrupted ZNF146 and ZNF507 expression in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) using CRISPR/Cas9 to determine what impact depleting these proteins can have on the transcriptome of a somatic cell line.

35100360_047,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"First, we confirmed Cas9 targeting by aligning RNA-seq reads to ZNF146 and ZNF507 cDNA reference sequences using Tophat2 and BWA aligners to rescue unmapped reads as previously described (Deininger et al. 2017). We then compared the coverage ratio of reads marked as having insertions or deletions (indels) during alignment vs. reads without indels. For both ZNF146 and ZNF507 indels were frequently detected at sgRNA target sites that were not observed in control cells, consistent with efficient disruption and protein depletion observed by western blot (Fig. 5b)."
35100360_048,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"We then assessed whether we could detect an increase in RNA originating from full-length L1 elements. Full-length and intact L1 elements are known to be heavily repressed in most cell lines. Because of this and their repetitive nature, the vast majority of full-length elements were not detected using uniquely mapping RNA-seq reads (see histogram of counts at or near zero in Fig. 5c). For those that were detectable we did not observe any that were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) in cell populations in which ZNF146 or ZNF507 were disrupted (Fig. 5c)."
35100360_049,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"Although intact LINE-1 elements are themselves highly unmappable by unique reads, their expression can reliably be detected in RNA-seq experiments by quantifying reads mapping to immediately downstream regions which become expressed as a result of read-through transcription (Philippe et al. 2016). Similar to what we observed within L1 elements, few RNA-seq reads mapped downstream of intact L1 elements, consistent with their general repression (Fig. 5d). For those downstream regions for which we did observe low-level expression, transcripts from these regions were not differentially expressed when ZNF146 or ZNF507 were disrupted. Although we cannot rule out increased levels of rare or stochastic L1 activation, these results indicate L1 elements are not broadly activated in response to ZNF146 and ZNF507 depletion in HEK293 cells."
35100360_050,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"ZNF146 and ZNF507 ChIP-seq peaks are not restricted to intergenic regions as we also observed many peaks for both proteins in regulatory and genic regions including at annotated enhancers and promoters (Fig. 6a). In addition, a large numbers of peaks (>50%) for both ZNF146 and ZNF507 were located in introns. Targeting to these regulatory and genic regions could potentially influence endogenous gene expression."

35100360_052,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"We therefore assessed what impact, if any, loss of ZNF146 or ZNF507 had on gene expression. Remarkably, despite observed binding peaks at over 40,000 sites in ChIP-seq data, we did not observe differential expression of any protein-coding or lncRNA (P < 0.05) in cells depleted of ZNF146 in HEK293 cells (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, however, ZNF507 disruption resulted in the differential expression of 30 protein-coding (24 up and 6 down-regulated) and 2 lncRNA (1 up and 1 downregulated) transcripts, indicating depletion of ZNF507 influenced nonretroviral gene expression (Fig. 6c,Table 1). Two differentially expressed genes had ZNF507 ChIP-seq peaks within 10 kb of their transcription start sites and twelve genes had peaks located within 100 kb, a common distance cutoff for cis regulatory elements (Vijayabaskar et al. 2019), suggesting these genes could potentially be directly regulated by ZNF507."
35100360_053,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"Transcription factors frequently regulate gene expression by recruiting chromatin modifying complexes to regulatory sequences. Hence, we wondered whether ZNF507 might associate with a known chromatin modifying enzyme. To test this idea, we expressed 3xFLAG-tagged ZNF507 in HEK293 cells by transient transfection (Fig. 7a) and performed co-immunoprecipitation followed by unbiased interaction discovery by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). FLAG-tagged ZNF507 localized as expected to the nucleus in HEK293 cells (Fig. 7b). Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed on cells expressing 3xFLAG-ZNF507 as well as an empty vector control using anti-FLAG beads. Proteins were eluted with 3xFLAG peptide and partially resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to proteomic analysis by LC-MS/MS."

These activities may then contribute to context or cell-type dependent regulation of LINE-1 elements or nearby genes. Schematics created with BioRender.com."
35100360_055,PMC8896011,RESULT,paragraph,"As expected, bait protein, ZNF507, had the highest peptide count in the 3xFLAG-ZNF507 IP with far more peptides in this sample compared to empty vector control (Table 2). The second most abundant protein (by peptide count) was protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), again with far more peptides detected in the 3xFLAG-ZNF507 IP than for the EV control. Interestingly, PRMT5 is a known transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression with various protein targets including core histones (Dacwag et al. 2007;Lacroix et al. 2008;Bedford and Clarke 2009;Tee et al. 2010;LeBlanc et al. 2016). These results suggest ZNF507 physically associates with PRMT5 and may recruit arginine methylation to L1 sequences to regulate L1 or endogenous gene expression (see model, Fig. 7c)."
35100360_056,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
35100360_057,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"About half of the human genome is comprised of repeat sequences that may serve underexplored roles in coordinated genome regulation. Unearthing proteins that target repetitive sequences may therefore serve as a launching pad for greater understanding of such processes. Over the past decade thousands of next generation data sets have been produced and made publicly available, most of which were processed without repeat sequences in mind. Taking a repeat-centric approach to mining these data sets may facilitate better understanding of the repeat genome and its influence on the biology of higher organisms."
35100360_058,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"There are many potential approaches to studying repeat enrichment in next generation sequencing data sets (Teissandier et al. 2019). Here, we took a simple peak intersection approach and analyzed publish ENCODE data sets to identify proteins specifically enriched on repetitive transposon-derived sequences. We identified over 200 TF ChIP-seq peak sets enriched on specific transposon sequences more than would be expected by random chance. Strikingly, many DNA-binding proteins appear to specifically target ERV-K transposons, for reasons we cannot readily explain. We then focused on a prominent enrichment of 2 putative L1-targeting proteins, ZNF146/OZF and ZNF507, and characterized their relationship to L1 sequences."
35100360_059,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Other groups have previously taken similar approaches to identify proteins enriched on repetitive elements in ChIP-seq data sets, either using related peak intersection approaches or taking additional steps to extract information from reads mapping to multiple places in the genome (Criscione et al. 2014;Jacobs et al. 2014;Schmitges et al. 2016;Barazandeh et al. 2018;Soraya Shehata 2020). Schmitges et al. used a similar approach to that taken here to calculate the percentage of peaks for ENCODE ChIP-seq data sets with TEs and independently identified ZNF146 as being enriched on L1 elements. During the preparation of this manuscript, ZNF507 was also recently identified by Shehata et al. as binding at L1 elements while performing large-scale analysis of ChIP-seq data sets."
35100360_060,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In comparison to some other studies, particularly Barazandeh et al. and Schmitges et al. referenced above using similar data sets, relatively few DNA binding proteins were found to specifically recognize L1 repeats. These studies took a slightly different approach, using simple peak intersection frequencies rather than enrichment over shuffled background models to identify interactors. This difference likely caused our approach to under identify genuine TE-targeting proteins and highlight only those with high-frequency binding in the genome. Less frequent binders (for instance those that bind in the often-truncated 5â-end of L1 elements) would likely be missed by the approach taken here as these peak interactions would fail to enrich over background shuffling models when compared to high-abundance and highly fragmented elements such as L1."
35100360_061,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Here, we focus on 2 such proteins, ZNF146 and ZNF507 targeting to L1 sequences and find these proteins target different regions of the ORF2-encoding region of L1 DNA sequences in the human genome. ZNF146 targets both âoldâ and âyoungâ L1 near the extreme 3â end of ORF2. In contrast, ZNF507 was found to bind the 5â end of L1 ORF2 and was only observed at younger elements. Thus, our findings add to the knowledge base of proteins that specifically recognize L1 elements in the genome including other L1-targeting proteins shown to differentiate between L1 subfamilies (Jacobs et al. 2014). We show that changes in the amino acid composition of ZNF507 zinc fingers during primate evolution paralleled changes to L1 DNA sequence, indicating ZNF507 and L1 sequence may have co-evolved during this time period or perhaps that ZNF507 may have recently acquired affinity for L1 repeats."
35100360_062,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Surprisingly little is known about the functions of either ZNF146/OZF or ZNF507 despite being widely expressed in human tissue (Uhlen et al. 2015,2017). Several years ago ZNF146 was shown to be overexpressed in various cancers, though the contribution or molecular mechanisms related to ZNF146/OZF in oncogenic transformation remains opaque (Ferbus et al. 1999,2003;Antoine et al. 2005b;Ma et al. 2020;Zhu et al. 2021). ZNF146 was shown to associate with telomeric protein Rap1 and thus may have a role in telomere maintenance (Antoine et al. 2005a). Recently, ZNF146 was additionally shown to associate with replisome subunits and influence replication fork progression under conditions of DNA replication stress (Feu et al. 2020). Future studies are needed to determine how LINE-1 targeting and these potential roles in regulating genomic integrity at telomeres and during replication are related."
35100360_063,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although we did not observe broad upregulation of L1 elements or identify any gene expression changes in HEK293 cells lacking ZNF146, it remains possible that ZNF146 has important roles for regulating transcription or epigenetic modifications in heterochromatic regions, which are enriched for L1 sequences. If so, their contribution to regulation may be obscured by DNA methylation or other redundant silencing mechanisms, analogous to the maintenance of inactive-X heterochromatin despite removal of XIST RNA (Csankovszki et al. 1999). Similarly, ZNF146 could have a more essential role in specific developmental states, as it was recently identified as a potential regulator of the naÃ¯ve primate pluripotency network (Boroviak et al. 2018). Since LINE-1 elements are known to be activated and regulate chromatin dynamics during early embryogenesis (Fadloun et al. 2013;Jachowicz et al. 2017), itâs tempting to speculate ZNF146/OZF is either involved in this activation or important for subsequent repression of LINE-1 elements post-activation. Future studies may address these potential connections between ZNF146, LINE-1 elements, pluripotency, and early development."
35100360_064,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"ZNF507 has been identified in genomic studies as being a potential risk locus for neural developmental disorders (Talkowski et al. 2012;Curtis and UK10K Consortium 2016). Despite this potential relationship, to our knowledge ZNF507 had not been the subject of directed investigation. Our experiments here demonstrate ZNF507 targets L1 âyoungâ elements and indicate ZNF507 depletion influences gene expression, potentially through interaction with PRMT5. Our transcriptomic analysis was performed in an embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293), which may not be the most relevant cell type to study ZNF507 function. Future experiments depleting ZNF507 in relevant neural cell types or neural organoids are needed to determine whether ZNF507 acts as a transcriptional regulator in these contexts. Identifying these targets could be key in determining what impact, if any, ZNF507 has on various brain disorders."
35100360_065,PMC8896011,DISCUSS,paragraph,"PRMT5 was recently shown to be a critical repressor of LINE-1 elements in primordial germ cells and early embryonic development (Kim et al. 2014). In this context, PRMT5-mediated methylation of histones is required to repress L1 expression during this unusual period of global reduction in DNA methylation. To our knowledge, how PRMT5 is targeted to LINE-1 sequences is largely unknown. Here, we identify a potential interaction between PRMT5 and ZNF507. Although this relationship requires further validation, results here indicate ZNF507âs primary function may be to recruit PRMT5-mediated arginine methyltransferase activity to chromatin in order to regulate L1 or endogenous gene expression during development."

38096902_007,PMC10830420,INTRO,paragraph,"Recent primate transposon evolution is dominated by RNA âcopy and pasteâ retrotransposons that insert RNA intermediates into the genome by encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) activity9. These retrotransposons are divided into two classes: (1) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs); and (2) the non-LTR retrotransposon long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1, L1)1. ERVs are no longer thought to be active in humans1. By contrast, each person inherits about 100 polymorphic and fixed potentially active L1s, a small subset of the approximately half a million inactive L1 copies and fragments1. LINEs have been coevolving with their hosts for 1â2 billion years, since the emergence of eukaryotes. Human L1 encodes two proteins, ORF1p10 and ORF2p, the latter having endonuclease (EN) and RT activities11â13, along with three other domains with unknown functions (Fig. 1a,b). ORF2p cotranslationally binds its encoding L1 RNA, a property termed âcis preferenceâ14â17, forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with many copies of ORF1 and host proteins10,15,17â19 (Fig. 1b). New insertions begin with the target primed reverse transcription (TPRT) priming mechanism: an EN nick on the âbottomâ DNA strand liberates a DNA 3â²-OH used to prime RT and generate an RNA:DNA hybrid intermediate20â23. The details of TPRT in L1, second strand synthesis and how the resulting intermediates are resolved remain unclear, although it is known that a subsequent staggered break in the second âtopâ DNA strand24 results in a characteristic target site duplication of typically less than 20âbase pairs (bp) flanking L1-mediated insertions24,25. Despite its cis preference, ORF2p also binds and inserts other RNAs, including messenger RNA sequences and short interspersed element RNAs such as Alu.Fig. 1Pathogenic replication cycle of L1 and the 2.1âÃ resolution crystal structure of human ORF2p core in a ternary complex.a, The 6âkb human L1 element contains an internal 5â² untranslated region (UTR) promoter, two proteins ORF1p and ORF2p in a bicistronic arrangement separated by 63ânt and a short 3â² UTR. b, Replication cycle of L1, a streamlined self-copying DNA parasite. Derepression of genomic L1s results in Pol II transcription and export of the L1 RNA, which is translated to form an RNP complex containing one copy ORF2p, a multifunctional enzyme, and many copies of ORF1p, a homotrimeric chaperone involved in nuclear entry that can form phase-separated granules. Canonically, in the nucleus, ORF2p integrates a new copy of the L1 RNA into the genome in a mechanism termed TPRT, in which cleavage by the L1 EN liberates a genomic DNA (gDNA) 3â²-OH used to prime reverse transcription of the L1 RNA, followed by insertion by poorly understood mechanisms (âDiscussionâ, Fig. 6). Non-canonical outcomes contribute to pathology: failed insertions and aberrant EN activity result in DNA damage and translocations, and aberrant cytosolic RT activity generates inflammatory RNA:DNA hybrids. Host proteins (not shown) are associated at every step and may repress L1 or function as essential cofactors. c, Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of pure, monodisperse 97âkDa ORF2p core after size exclusion chromatography. d, Two newÂ domains (tower and wrist) and three canonical RT subdomains (fingers, palm, thumb) coordinate with a hybrid duplex RNA template (purple) and DNA primer (cyan) and incoming dTTP nucleotide (yellow) for ORF2p core RT activity in the 2.1âÃ resolution crystal structure in a âright-handâ RT fold that is uniquely adapted. All five ORF2p core domains contact the template or primer, and numerous residues contact the incoming base; protein contacts are summarized in the inset schematic."
38096902_008,PMC10830420,INTRO,paragraph,"Derepressed L1 elements can contribute to the pathology of cancer, ageing, neurodegeneration and inflammation (mechanisms posited in Fig. 1b). Consistent with this, RT inhibitors have shown promising results in model systems6â8,26,27 and in clinical studies of colorectal cancer28 and AicardiâGoutiÃ¨res syndrome, a rare Mendelian interferonopathy characterized by accumulation of L1 intermediates4,27,29. However, our knowledge of the mechanistic details of both L1 insertion and how L1 contributes to pathophysiology is limited. The best characterized L1 relatives are insect R2 LINE elements21 and bacterial group II mobile introns30,31, which lack the amino-terminal apurinic/apyrimidinic EN (APE)-like EN of ORF2p12,13 and diverged from the human lineage around 700 million and 4 billion years ago, respectively. Both recognize and mobilize unique DNA and RNA sequences, limiting comparison with L1."
38096902_009,PMC10830420,INTRO,paragraph,"To address knowledge gaps in L1 biology and facilitate the potential for drug discovery, we have established systems to purify both full-length ORF2p and a minimal âcoreâ, characterized ORF2p RT activity, and determined its structure using various modalities. Our investigation revealed (1) efficient RT priming by short RNAs and hairpins; (2) direct cytosolic synthesis of RNA:DNA hybrids that activate cGAS-STING, resulting in interferon production; (3) a series of conformational adaptations in the âright-handedâ fingers, palm and thumb RT fold that are likely to modulate biochemical activities required for the replication cycle of L1; (4) the presence of two previously undescribedÂ domains in the RT core, which we name âtowerâ and âwristâ; and (5) concerted dynamics of the N-terminal EN and carboxy-terminal domain (CTD). Informed by this structure, we elucidate the evolutionary relationships between conserved structural features in ORF2p. Our results shed light on previously enigmatic steps in the L1 replication cycle, its roles in pathophysiology and potential routes to therapeutics."

Here, we optimized purification of the ORF2p core (residues 238â1061) to yield milligram quantities of more than 99% pure enzyme (Fig. 1c) that was monomeric (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and highly active against oligo(A) templates (Extended Data Fig. 1b), enabling structural and kinetic analyses, as well as single-base-resolution assays with various substrates and inhibitors."

The structure represents a ternary complex with an incoming deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) nucleotide and a templateâprimer heteroduplex containing a three-nucleotide (nt) 5â² overhang in the RNA template and 3â² dideoxy-terminated DNA primer. The complex crystallized in space group C2, with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. The structure (Fig. 1d) reveals the fingers, palm and thumb of a characteristic right-hand RT fold but also shows key differences compared with other RTs. Two folded domains which we name âwristâ (863â1061) and âtowerâ (240â440, Figs. 1d and 2, described below) are absent from other known structures of RT enzymes from viruses or mobile elements.

38096902_015,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"As in other RTs, the fingers, palm and thumb domains form a groove that cradles the RNA templateâDNA primer heteroduplex. Nucleotide positions in the template and primer are numbered nâ3 to n+10 relative to 5â², and nâ1 is the templating ribonucleoside and incoming deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) (Fig. 1d, insets, and Extended Data Fig. 1e). We identify template contacts in both new domains: the tower contacts the 5â² RNA template at the nâ3 base, and the wrist makes multiple contacts with the downstream region of the template (3â² end). The overall configuration of the active site and resultant catalytic mechanism are highly conserved throughout RTs and related polymerases30,34: in a region of the palm termed the N-site, the incoming dNTP base pairs with the nâ1 base on the template and is poised for covalent linkage to the 3â² hydroxyl of the primer n+1 deoxyribose ring. The catalytic triad of aspartic acids (D600, D702, D703) resides at the active site and coordinates a Mg2+ ion and the dNTP; D702 and D703 form the base of the FADD loop (Fig. 1d, inset). The gatekeeping residue F605 has an aromatic side chain that selects against ribonucleotides with a 2â² hydroxyl, which probably explains the inability of ORF2p to function as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); Extended Data Figs. 1d and 4c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). The 5â² upstream RNA template enters ORF2p above the fingertips, with eight residues contacting nâ3, including hydrogen bonding between the base and an extended palm loop and the tower. The template next interacts with the R0 loop, which forms a âlidâ over the template RNA. This loop is a portion of the R0 region, also called the N-terminal extension (NTE)-0, which is found in non-LTR retrotransposons, the group IIC intron and HCV RdRp, but not in viral RTs30, and has been demonstrated to be important for template jumping and/or switching activity35,36 (âDomain comparison of ORF2p and other RTsâ). The downstream template makes extensive interactions continuing until the n+8 position with fingers, palm, wrist and thumb (Fig. 1, diagram). The DNA primer is contacted through the n+5 position, held upstream by the primer grip and downstream by the thumb with the helix clamp at its base."

38096902_017,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"The wrist domain (863â1061) has not been previously recognized, although experiments deleting large portions of the wrist and the subsequent CTD have shown that both domains are required for efficient retrotransposition37. Scanning mutagenesis also has shown numerous wrist regions required for retrotransposition38. The fold consists of 12 helices anchored to the RT through interactions with the thumb helices and palm through a helix at residues 573â581 and a short Î² turn at residues 688â695. Searches on similarity servers Dali and Foldseek show weak similarity to a sterile alpha motif-like domain, indicating possible roles in nucleic acid binding or proteinâprotein interactions. In the structure, the wrist makes numerous backbone contacts with the RNA template through n+4 to n+7, and trialanine mutants spanning these residues have resulted in reduced or no retrotransposition activity38."

38096902_019,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"We next measured the thermal stability of ORF2p in differential scanning fluorometry assays, in which heat-induced denaturation results in increasing exposure of the hydrophobic core of the protein and resultant binding and fluorescence of the SYPRO Orange dye. Apo ORF2p, lacking bound nucleic acid, was unstable, with a melting temperature (Tm) of 34.1âÂ±â0.4âÂ°C. ORF2p was markedly stabilized by binding single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (ÎTmâ=â14.4âÂ±â0.6âÂ°C) and further stabilized by binding an RNA:DNA hybrid (Fig. 2a; ÎTm from ssRNA-boundâ=â2.7âÂ±â0.4âÂ°C, ÎTm from apoâ=â16.1âÂ±â0.4âÂ°C). To understand the structural changes resulting from binding of the primer and template, we used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM; Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) to obtain reconstructions of ORF2p in three distinct states: in an active ternary complex with incoming dTTP and templateâprimer; bound to oligo-25(A) ssRNA; and in apo form (to 3.30, 3.66 and 4.06âÃ resolution, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 2a). This is the first reported structure of an RT bound with ssRNA in the active site."
38096902_020,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"The density for the active ternary complex was complete and facilitated building of a structural model with clear density for the incoming dNTP, Mg2+ and templateâprimer (Fig. 2b, inset left). The cryo-EM-derived atomic model was predominantly indistinguishable from the crystal structure, with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1.01âÃ in towerâfingersâpalmâthumb. There was apparent flexibility between the wrist and the rest of ORF2p, but the wrist fold itself was predominantly unchanged between the two structures (wrist backbone RMSDâofâ4.04âÃ, aligned wrist RMSDâ=â1.01âÃ, overall RMSD including wrist 3.68âÃ; Extended Data Fig. 2b). Comparison of heteroduplex and ssRNA-bound states revealed distinct template paths (template RMSDâofâ3.76âÃ; Fig. 2b, inset right) but overall maintenance of similar contacts through movement of flexible loops, notably in the palm and wrist domains. Intriguingly, although the structure was not as high resolution, the apo ORF2p was found in a âthumb upâ conformation, in which the template binding and active sites were accessible; by contrast, apo viral RTs assumed an inactive âthumb downâ conformation, in which the thumb occupied the nucleic-acid-binding site (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). This âthumb upâ conformation, the instability of the apo protein and tight RNA binding are likely to contribute to the cis preference of L1."
38096902_021,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Structure of the L1 tower domain
38096902_022,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"ORF2p contains an N-terminal APE-like EN13 and is the first such retrotransposon to be structurally characterized; other classes of non-LTR retrotransposons have C-terminal restriction-like ENs (RLE)22â24. The tower domain (239â440) corresponds to the region between the EN and RT domains and consists of four key components, (1) a baseplate (residues 254â300), (2) the protruding tower helices (residues 301â370), (3) the subsequent tower lock (residues 374â382) and (4) a PIP box helix (PCNA-interacting protein, residues 404â419), and encompasses regions previously termed âcrypticâ or âdesertâ38,39. Structure similarity searches did not show significant similarities to other proteins. The tower baseplate (Fig. 2c) was resolved to residue 304 in the crystal and 310 in our EM model. The tower and lock were anchored to RT at two points: (1) by the baseplate to fingers through mostly hydrophobic contacts, and (2) by PIP to the palm and fingers by a mix of hydrophobic and polar interactions. Mutation of key residues in the baseplate reduce retrotransposition39, and PIP orchestrates an ORF2pâPCNA interaction that depends on EN and RT activities and is required for retrotransposition17,18,39. AlphaFold2 modelling indicates that the intervening helices form an elongated hairpin-like tower, which seems to be flexible. Modelling using molecular dynamics simulations and AlphaFold indicated that the tower lock is consistent with orphan density above the n+4 base in low-pass filtered cryo-EM maps of ssRNA-bound ORF2p and may therefore fold down and âcapâ the RNA template (Extended Data Fig. 2d). A functionally similar tower lock was present in the smaller tower-like domain in R2, despite sequence divergence (see domain comparison below)22,23. To test the importance of the unresolved tower and tower lock on RT activity, we purified ORF2p mutants that truncated the tower (Î302â363) or tower and tower lock (Î302â389), replacing them with short flexible linkers (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Both constructs were active similarly to the wild type in RT assays (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d), but trialanine mutagenesis has shown no retrotransposition with mutants in various regions of the tower and in the lock38. Together, these data demonstrate that the ORF2p tower is important for L1 retrotransposition but not RT activity. They also indicate that ORF2p fragments consisting of portions of the tower base may be able to bind to the rest of ORF2p in trans, enabling âbipartileâ Alu retrotransposition39."
38096902_023,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,ORF2p RT and polymerase activities
38096902_024,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"ORF2p can polymerize DNA on RNA or DNA templates (RT or pol activities) with approximately equal efficiency using either DNA or RNA primers. RNA priming of cDNA synthesis on an RNA template is less efficient but still occurs at a significant rate (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). This reduced but significant level of L1 ORF2p RNA priming on RNA templates is in stark contrast with HIV-1 RT, for which only specialized RNA primers are used in initiation, at an efficiency reduced by orders of magnitude40. L1 ORF2p RNA synthesis (RdRp activity) was strongly selected against, with minimal detectable activity (Extended Data Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 3c). In single-nucleotide additions with long 20ânt primers, ORF2p had no apparent preference for an RNA or DNA template. HIV-1 RT and human ERV K (HERV-K) RT34 also accept both templates and have roughly ten-fold and two-fold higher efficiency of single nucleotide incorporations than L1 ORF2p, respectively. By contrast, whereas ORF2p efficiently extended 5ânt DNA primers on DNA or RNA templates, HIV-1 RT had markedly reduced efficiency with 6ânt primers in RT reactions, was incapable of reverse transcribing a 5ânt primer, and did not extend primers 5â10ânt long on DNA templates (Extended Data Figs. 4a,b and 5a,b). ORF2p was highly processive and unaffected by a heparin competitor, whereas HIV-1 RT was significantly less processive at baseline and did not produce full-length template with a heparin competitor in any condition (Extended Data Fig. 5c).Fig. 3L1 biochemical activities, priming and cytoplasmic reverse transcription of L1.a, Denaturing gel ORF2p RT assay. ORF2p core was an efficient DNA polymerase on all templateâprimer combinations; RNA priming on an RNA template was reduced but remained significant, with time-dependent full template-length (FTL) reaction products.

Cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids colocalized with ORF2p, depended on RT activity, were ablated by 50âÂµM d4T and did not depend on EN activity, ruling out a nuclear origin. Hybrids were most prominent in L1 granules but were still present when ORF1p was removed (ORF2 only, monocistronic). g, Top left, ORF1p induction by 1âÂµM decitabine in THP1 monocytes.

38096902_025,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"ORF2p also consistently produced larger products of two types, which increased with both longer reaction times and higher concentrations of reaction components: (1) non-templated addition (NTA, or 3â² tailing), in which single bases are added beyond the 5â² end of the template; and (2) template jumping or template switching products, in which polymerization of the same cDNA strand (copy of template1) continues on a new incoming template molecule (template2) that is accepted and copied, making a concatemer (copy of template1â+âcopy of template2 (Supplementary Fig. 4). No NTA or template jumping activities of ORF2p were detectable with HIV-1 RT (Extended Data Fig. 5b). These activities have been well characterized in other non-LTR transposons and are thought to be important for completion of an insertion (âDiscussionâ) but have not previously been shown for ORF2p. NTA activity mechanistically explains previously reported â5â² extra nucleotidesâ or âmicrohomologiesâ observed in naturally occurring25 and engineered L1 insertions41,42."
38096902_026,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"ORF2p is known to tolerate some terminal mismatches in priming in crude RNP complex preparations15,16. In assays with an RNA template terminating in A, ORF2p showed little discrimination against terminal mismatches, with the exception of A:G, which retained some detectable activity. These results are similar to those of previous studies using RNP preparations16, in which the predominant template was presumed to be the poly(A) tail, and the similarity between the two results is evidence that most ORF2p in L1 RNP preparations rests on the poly(A) tail15â17. C:U and T:U internal mismatches at the second-to-last position are also tolerated, along with a UA:TC double mismatch, to a lesser extent. Overall, ORF2p is similarly active to HIV-1 RT but tolerates more mismatches (A:A and A:G mismatches are not tolerated by HIV-1 RT; Extended Data Fig. 4d). This reduced specificity may facilitate priming against diverse cellular sequences."
38096902_027,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Requirements for ORF2p priming
38096902_028,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"ORF2p efficiently extends DNA primers as short as 5ânt on RNA or DNA templates, with slightly lower efficiency at 5 and 6ânt than at 7â20ânt (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Figs. 4b and 5b). This is consistent with requirements of 4â6âbp annealing seen in RNP preparation assays, in which the predominant template is assumed to be the poly(A) tail16, and with the five primer bases that contact ORF2p (Fig. 1d). These priming results led us to investigate whether L1 ORF2p might directly accept and extend short RNA hairpin substrates. ORF2p efficiently extended a previously published 29ânt RNA hairpin containing a 7ânt duplex (Fig. 3d) and a similar hairpin derived from the substrates tested above (Supplementary Fig. 5), even at the lowest dNTP concentration tested (0.1âÂµM), which was at least ten-fold lower than the physiologic dNTP concentration43. This activity was barely detectable with HIV-1 RT at 100âÂµM, a difference in activity of at least four orders of magnitude; by contrast, the two enzyme preparations were similarly active in RT reactions (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Figs. 4d and 5b). As recent studies report cytosolic synthesis of Alu cDNA and indicate possible priming against the oligo(A) tail by the pol-III terminal U-tract26, we tested an Alu-derived sequence and found that this hairpin was also efficiently extended by ORF2p (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5). In all cases, RNA synthesis was strongly selected against, although more activity was consistently seen at 1âmM NTPs; this concentration is likely to be supraphysiologic for all but ATP43. Together, these results demonstrate that ORF2p can synthesize cDNA primed only by short RNA sequences and hairpins at physiologic concentrations of dNTPs, providing a potential mechanistic basis for its cytosolic RT activity6,7,26."

Although RT inhibitors often reduce or ablate cDNA levels, their origin has remained uncertain. We transfected HeLa and U2-OS cells with plasmids expressing L1 and found robust cytosolic RNA:DNA hybrids in transfected cells that colocalized with both L1 proteins, depended on RT activity, and were unaffected by loss of EN activity. Their formation was inhibited by 50âÂµM d4T treatment (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6aâc). Hybrids were seen using synthetic ORFeus-Hs L1 and native L1RP sequences and with two different detection reagents: S9.6, a well-established monoclonal antibody known also to bind dsRNA under some conditions, and purified catalytically inactive human RNase H1 (dRNH1), which has recently been reported to be more specific for hybrids in imaging experiments. Hybrids were also detectable in some cells in smaller punctae when ORF2p was expressed in the absence of ORF1 (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 6aâc). As EN-independent retrotransposition occurs at levels at least 100-fold lower than wild type44, these results rule out a nuclear origin for these cytosolic hybrids and demonstrate that L1 can directly synthesize RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol."

Treating THP1 cells with 1âÂµM decitabine derepresses L1 expression by preventing DNA methylation during replication and results in interferon production28,45,46 (Fig. 3g). Knockout of TREX1 (three-prime repair exonuclease 1), a nuclease that is mutated in AicardiâGoutiÃ¨res syndrome and systemic lupus erythematous and that has been shown to degrade cytosolic L1 DNA4,27,29, increased both baseline and decitabine-induced interferon levels (Fig. 3g). Both baseline and decitabine-induced interferon levels were reduced by treatment with a cGAS inhibitor (10âÂµM G140) or RT inhibitor (RTI; 50âÂµM d4T) (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). As d4T potency was modest in this assay, we tested whether triphosphorylation of d4T was limiting inhibition by synthesizing a POC prodrug of d4T (POC d4TÂ (d4T bis(isopropoxycarbonyloxymethyl)phosphate;Â SupplementaryÂ Fig. 6b)). POC d4T was approximately 30-fold more potent than d4T in suppressing interferon secretion, which provides compelling evidence that d4T triphosphate is the active form that inhibits ORF2p (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 6e). Together, these results demonstrateÂ that cytosolic cDNA synthesis by L1 results in interferon production through the cGAS/STING pathway."

38096902_034,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"A critical path towards treating diseases associated with RT activity, such as HIV and HBV infections, is the use of RTIs40. Given the emerging role of L1 in disease, we sought to determine whether current RTIs had activity against ORF2p. Titrating nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) forms of nucleoside RTIs (NRTIs) into gel-based L1 RT assays showed that 3TC (lamivudine, Extended Data Fig. 7a) and carbovir (the active metabolite of abacavir) were modest ORF2p inhibitors (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 5â7âÂµM), whereas d4T (stavudine) and entecavir were more potent (IC50 0.4â0.6âÂµM, Extended Data Fig. 7a). To enable robust high-throughput inhibition analysis, we developed homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assays for ORF2p RT. NRTI NTPs all inhibited ORF2p to varying extents, with thymidine analogues dideoxythymidine (ddT) and d4T the most potent (IC50â<â10ânM), followed by AZT and 3TC as modest inhibitors under these conditions (IC50 200â750ânM)33 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7b,c). By contrast, none of the six tested allosteric HIV-1 non-nucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs) inhibited ORF2p; notably, even 1âmM nevirapine showed no inhibition (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 7c and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Using a stable dual luciferase retrotransposition reporter system in HeLa cells, we confirmed previously published modest inhibition of L1 by d4T, 3TC, FTC (emtricitabine), AZT, tenofovir and GBS-149 (IC50 1â5âÂµM)33 (Extended Data Fig. 7d). GBS-149 potency was not significantly different from that of related 3TC and FTC; the HCV inhibitor sofosbuvir did not inhibit L1 at up to 30âÂµM (Extended Data Fig. 7d). Differences between the in vitro and cell-based assays may be attributable to differential triphosphorylation of NRTIs.Fig. 4Inhibition and structure of full-length ORF2p.a, The ORF2p core was inhibited by NRTIs but not allosteric NNRTI HIV inhibitors in vitro according to homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay (nâ=â3 wells). b, 3TC inhibition in gel-based RT assay of full-length ORF2p WT (FADD) or HIV-like (FMDD).

38096902_036,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"Potency against ORF2p varied almost 200-fold between NRTIs tested, and AZT and 3TC were not potent inhibitors (Fig. 4a). In HIV-1, resistance to 3TC can come from M184 mutations in RT (YMDD to YVDD/YIDD), which cause a steric clash with the oxathiolane ring47. HIV-1 mutants to Ala (YADD, like FADD in ORF2p) have been studied with respect to 3TC potency, demonstrating that van der Waals interactions between M184 and the 3TC oxathiolane ring are stabilizing; these interactions are not present with the smaller A701 (FADD) in ORF2p, and this difference may explain the relatively lower potency of 3TC against L1 ORF2p RT. Modelling the related 3TT-TP analogue into the active site of L1 using the cocrystal structure of dTTP confirmed the proximity of M701 to the oxathiolane ring, whereas the A701 in wild-type L1 was further away. Further supporting this mode of inhibition, 3TC was approximately 15-fold more potent in inhibiting A701M mutant full-length ORF2p (FMDD) than wild type (FADD, Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7e). On the basis of these results, HIV-1 inhibition40 and analyses of HERV-K34, we conclude that 3TC and related FTC and GBS-149 are unlikely to be selective for L1 ORF2p."
38096902_037,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"To understand the structural basis underlying differences between AZT and more potent thymidine analogues, we modelled the triphosphates of thymidine-based NRTIs into the ORF2p ternary crystal structure containing dTTP in the N-site. As expected, ddTTP and d4T-TP did not show any clashes with the protein, as they closely resemble the shape of dTTP. However, the AZT-TP model showed a clash of the middle nitrogen of the 3â²-azido group with amide hydrogen of F605 (distance 2.03âÃ, Fig. 4c), which was not relieved by energy minimization. This clash was not observed in the crystal structure of AZT-TP bound to HIV-1 RT (respective distance 2.28âÃ, Fig. 4c). The inability to remove the clash in ORF2p may be explained by a difference in conformational flexibility of the region around the 3â²-azido group (residues 602â607 in ORF2p and 112â117 in HIV-1 RT). In ORF2p, this segment contains two internal salt bridges that are absent from HIV-1 RT and has lower average backbone B factors than HIV-1 with respect to the complete dNTP site (defined as all residues within 6âÃ of dTTP; site versus region in ORF2p, 43.4 versus 48.1; HIV-1 RT, 114.3 versus 110.7). Calculations on the basis of free energy perturbation simulations of the relative ORF2p binding of these nucleotides showed an insignificant difference in relative binding free energy (ÎG) between ddTTP and d4T, but a large positive difference between these and AZT (Supplementary Fig. 6c), consistent with the greater than 20-fold change in ORF2p inhibitory activity of AZT compared with ddTTP and d4T (Fig. 4a)."
38096902_038,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"As inhibition of telomerase RT (TERT) would be a potential source of toxicity in a therapy, we investigated the relative selectivity of NRTI triphosphates for L1 versus TERT, testing the panel of NRTI triphosphates in a biochemical TERT assay. The tested compounds were generally around 1,000-fold less potent inhibitors of TERT than L1 RT, with IC50 in the mid-micromolar range (for example, the IC50 of d4T-TP was 9ânM versus ORF2p and 15âÂµM versus TERT; Supplementary Fig. 7a); this result was in line with expectations, because these drugs are all tolerated therapeutically in patients. The structures of the active sites of the two enzymes explain these stark differences, with a more hydrophobic environment in the ORF2p active site (Supplementary Fig. 7b,c). NRTIs designed for HCV RdRp are also unlikely to inhibit L1 as drugs of this class, like sofosbuvir, contain 2â² modifications mimicking the 2â²-OH of an incoming ribonucleoside triphosphate. This was first confirmed by modelling of sofosbuvir into the ORF2p active site, which revealed a clash between the sofosbuvir 2â² F and the gatekeeping residue F605; this was further confirmed in cell-based L1 assays, which showed no inhibition by sofosbuvir (Extended Data Fig. 7d and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Together, these results demonstrate that the ORF2p crystal structure provides a useful starting point for structure-based design of new ORF2p-specific NRTIs."
38096902_039,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"NRTIs act at the RT active site and are known to inhibit ORF2p with varying potency, whereas HIV-1 NNRTIs33 bind to an induced allosteric site in the palm between the primer grip, the Î²-sheet containing the YMDD loop and the 94â102 segment40; this pocket is absent from HBV, HIV-2 and HERV-K34. HIV-1 NNRTIs do not inhibit ORF2p (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d), and structural and sequence differences between the HIV-1 NNRTI pocket and the equivalent region in ORF2p explain this lack of inhibition (Fig. 4d). As HIV-1 RT undergoes a conformational change when NNRTIs bind, the HIV-1 RT structure in the absence of NNRTI was compared with the ORF2p crystal structure. The most striking difference was replacement of the 94â102 segment of HIV-1 RT with a longer Î±-helix formed by residues 572â588 in ORF2p, making none of these positions structurally equivalent. In addition, residues Y181 and Y188, which have been implicated in aromatic ring stacking with nevirapine and other NNRTIs40, were replaced with S698 and I705, respectively, and the small residue G190 in HIV-1 RT was replaced with bulky Y707 in ORF2p. These differences, taken together, explain why ORF2p does not form a pocket that binds HIV-1 NNRTIs."
38096902_040,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Structure of full-length ORF2p
38096902_041,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"Purified full-length ORF2p was similarly active to the ORF2p core in single-nucleotide-resolution RT assays and was similarly inhibited by 3TC (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 7f and Supplementary Fig. 8aâc), indicating that EN and CTD may not directly modulate RT activity. Monodisperse full-length ORF2p, bound to the same short RNA17âDNA14 hybrid used above for cryo-EM of the ORF2p core, was analysed by negative stain transmission electron microscopy and found to be monomeric and probably flexible, with two-dimensional classes indicating multiple conformations (Fig. 4f, raw contour, and Supplementary Figs. 9â10). To elucidate the conformational landscape of ORF2p, we used cryo-EM maps, cross-linking mass spectrometry, AlphaFold2 and molecular dynamics simulations to generate an ensemble of conformational states using the Integrative Modeling Platform (Supplementary Figs. 8d,e, 9 and 10 and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Informed by AlphaFold2 and molecular dynamics simulations, we first segmented the EN, tower and CTD into 15 rigid bodies connected by 14 flexible linkers and computed an ensemble of integrative models satisfying the input data (Fig. 4g; conformational heterogeneity and model uncertainty is represented as localization densities). The ensemble was then validated by matching computed two-dimensional model projections to negative stain two-dimensional class averages: each class average was assigned a best-matching model and each matched model fit the data better than the parental AlphaFold model (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 10). Structural clustering of these best-matching models indicated two distinct groups (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 10), which we named ORF2p open and closed-ring states, that were characterized by unique positions of the EN and tower. Closure of the ring entailed an approximately 48âÃ movement of the tower domain (measured from the top of the tower), hinging at the baseplate and bringing it adjacent to the CTD. To test potential roles of these states, we repeated the negative stain EM with ORF2p bound instead to a 376ânt RNA derived from the 3â² end of L1RP with a 14 A tail. Many classes overlapped, but there was also a significantly increased number of closed-ring states and a reduction in open states (Supplementary Fig. 10bâd). We interpret these differences to mean that the closed state may represent a predominant conformation when ORF2p is bound to messenger RNA, whereas the open state may be involved in retrotransposition."
38096902_042,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Domain comparison of ORF2p and other RTs
38096902_043,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"To better understand specific adaptations of ORF2p, we compared it with diverse structurally characterized RTs: the R2 LINE element from the silk moth Bombyx mori (R2Bm)22, the distantly related mobile group IIC intron RT from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GsI-IIC)30, the RT from LTR element HERV-K34 and HIV-1 RT (Extended Data Fig. 8a). The structure of the group IIC intron was chosen over the evolutionarily closer group IIB intron31 because it represents the same active form with substrate in the active site and is higher resolution, although members of the IIB family were included in the wider evolutionary analysis (see below). ORF2p is larger than the other enzymes, with limited similarity outside the conserved right-hand fingersâpalmâthumb subdomains in RTs. Structural alignment of all five enzymes by palm superposition highlighted conserved RT sequence blocks and showed that ORF2p had insertions in fingers (motifs 0, 2a) and palm (motif 3a, 6a) and permutation of the thumb helices compared with both HIV-1 and HERV-K."
38096902_044,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"Viral and LTR transposon RTs, represented by HIV-1 and HERV-K, are distinct from the non-LTR RTs in that they encode their own RNase H, located C-terminally, and GsI-IIC has a DNA-binding D domain in this position (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d and Supplementary Fig. 11). Other than GsI-IIC D, these CTDs all stabilize the polymerase complex by coordinating downstream nucleic acids but do so in distinct ways. The ORF2p wrist binds the template close to the active site; the connection and RNase H domains of viral/LTR elements bind distally; and, although the linker of R2Bm makes limited and distinct nucleic acid contacts, most of its function seems to be coordination of the activity of the C-terminal RLE domain22,48. In R2Bm, RLE cuts ssDNA, which in the context of initiation is melted from the dsDNA target by the adjacent C-terminal CCHC zinc finger (ZnF)22,24,48. The ORF2p CTD is required for retrotransposition37,38 and has a similarly positioned CCHC motif (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig. 11) that may also melt target DNA and/or bind single-stranded nucleic acid49, but its function remains unclear."
38096902_045,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"In comparison with R2Bm, the ORF2p domain topology is reversed: ORF2p apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE)-like EN is located N-terminally and cuts dsDNA rather than ssDNA12,13,22,50. Structurally, ORF2p EN sits on the opposite wall of the polymerase groove to R2Bm RLE, atop fingers rather than thumb (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Supplementary Fig. 11). This seems to position the target DNA in reverse orientation to the active site for the two enzymes, although other orientations are possible (Extended Data Fig. 9). The tower of ORF2p seems to play a part in dynamic positioning of the EN. A smaller domain that we term âtower-likeâ is present in R2 (residues 305â374); this region was previously annotated as NTE-1 and contains the tower lock as well as helices analogous to ORF2p PIP that anchor the tower lock to fingers and palm. However, the PIP box, tower and tower baseplate are not present in R2. R2Bm also has two N-terminal domains, Myb and N-ZnF, that recognize specific ribosomal DNA sequences unique to the element, reflecting the extremely high sequence specificity of R2 for a single site in the ribosomal DNA."
38096902_046,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Structural adaptations of ORF2p RT
38096902_047,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"There are numerous contrasting features of the N-terminal regions of the four RT families (Extended Data Fig. 8b). Viral and LTR RTs have an Î±-helix posterior to the fingertips, which is absent from the group II intron RT but occupied by the tower-like helix of R2Bm and the PIP helix in ORF2p. The fingertips of all four representative RTs are similar in that they provide a hydrophobic surface for sliding the template bases (notably I515, I517 and I533 in ORF2p), but ORF2p and R2Bm both have a distinctive insertion in the fingertips loop. The upstream template path differs significantly in all four enzymes: in viral and LTR RTs, the 5â² template is pushed away from the fingertips by Ï-stacking with a characteristic tryptophan (W38 HERV-K, W24 HIV-1), whereas the non-LTR transposons and group II intron have a groove formed by the conserved R0 region with a loop that forms a lid for the template. Here, ORF2p is also distinct: the fingertips for group II intron and R2Bm have an arginine (R63 and R446, respectively) that forms a salt bridge with the nâ2 phosphate, pushing the nâ3 base away from the posterior side of the fingertips, whereas the analogous residue in ORF2p (T638) is significantly smaller and allows the nâ3 base to fold into a hydrophobic pocket created by a loop from the palm anchored by I642. The result of this is an apparently different entry path of the template RNA. The R0 region also differs significantly between ORF2p and the group II intron and R2Bm: the R0 loop in ORF2p is the longest of the three and makes no primer contacts; by contrast, the group II intron and R2Bm both contact the n+6 primer backbone."
38096902_048,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"In these RT families, the proximal primer is anchored by a conserved primer grip in the palm, which contains a characteristic hydrophobic motif helix clamp (Extended Data Fig. 8c). C-terminal to the primer grip is the thumb domain, a parallel three-helix bundle that occupies the minor groove of the templateâprimer heteroduplex and makes extensive primer contacts. The thumb in LTR RTs is permuted relative to the other families: the second helix of ORF2p, R2Bm, and the group II intron is functionally analogous to the first Î±-helix in viral and LTR RTs and contains the helix clamp subdomain at its base30 (Extended Data Fig. 8c). The helix clamp proline in non-LTR RTs (P819 in ORF2p) assumes a similar function to the glycine in LTR RTs and the group II intron, allowing proximity to the minor groove, and the subsequent aromatic residue (Y823 in ORF2p) forms Ï-interactions with the primer n+2 or n+3 nucleotide backbone. The wrist of ORF2p makes more extensive contacts with the downstream template than either the group II intron D domain or the R2Bm linker."
38096902_049,PMC10830420,RESULTS,title_1,Structural insight into L1 evolution
38096902_050,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"L1 dates to at least the Precambrian era51; on the basis of limited sequence similarity, it is speculated to have a putative common ancestor with bacterial mobile group II introns51 and has no clear evolutionary ancestor among extant viruses. We therefore sought to use protein structure to shed light on the conserved features and evolutionary origin of ORF2p that cannot be identified by sequence alignment alone. We used multiple sequence/structural alignments and AlphaFold2 predictions to examine conservation of the human ORF2p structure relative to 57 other L1 ORF2p sequences from vertebrates and plants. By computing and plotting the residue-level diversity of the aligned ORF2ps as the Shannon entropy (Fig. 5a andÂ Supplementary Methods), we found high concordance between the two multiple alignment strategies (sequence versus structural) in the RT domain (fingersâpalmâthumb, Supplementary Fig. 12a). Despite relatively lower sequence conservation in regions of the tower, wrist and CTD domains, the structure was conserved, indicating that domain topology may be more important than the sequence of these domains for L1 function. Leveraging data from a published trialanine mutagenesis library of 417 consecutive AAA ORF2p mutants, in which residual function of mutants was compared with that of the wild type (100%)38, we found that structural entropy was significantly correlated with residues dispensable for retrotransposition activity (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Fig. 12a). As most mutations resulted in reduced function, these results together indicate that optimization of retrotransposition is a main evolutionary driving force.Fig. 5Structural evolutionary analysis of ORF2p.a, Structural Shannon entropy (âstructural entropyâ) in ORF2p, measured from 57 L1 sequences from diverse vertebrates and plants and smoothed by averaging a 130-residue (approximately 10% of protein length) sliding window was lowest in the ancestral palm domain and highest in the C-terminal domain. b, Structural entropy correlates strongly with retrotransposition (retroT, ****Pâ<â10â15, two-tailed t-test), comparing with retroT measurements from 417 consecutive scanning trialanine mutants of ORF2p38. c, Mapping retroT and structural entropy onto the structure of ORF2p highlighted the overall concordance, as well as a notable discordance in the helix clamp around residue Y823 (inset). d, Structural perplexity, an information-theoretic measurement of the structural distance between two proteins, relative to ORF2p RT of a curated set of 50 proteins calculated using Plexy (Supplementary Methods). e, Normalized structural perplexity between full-length ORF2p and all proteins in the curated set, represented using multidimensional scaling such that the relative pairwise Euclidean distances were preserved (Supplementary Methods). For RT and RT-like proteins, the polypeptide with polymerase activity is used; for other proteins, the entire biological assembly is used. Dashed red lines represent the first and second standard deviations of the two-dimensional distance from full-length ORF2p. 2D, two-dimensional."
38096902_051,PMC10830420,RESULTS,paragraph,"We next compared ORF2p and other proteins with the intention of identifying shared structural features and inferring evolutionary relationships. First, we manually curated a set of 50 experimental protein structures that represented main families: RTs, RdRps, DdDps (DNA-dependent DNA polymerases)Â and DdDps/RdRps, as well as ânegative controlsâ that should have little resemblance to the other proteins (Supplementary Table 3). We then sought to represent structural similarity in a manner that would faithfully account for differences in protein length, account for inherent alignment quantity/quality trade-offs, and address a limitation of other methods, such as RMSD, in which different relative orientations of otherwise identical domains result in poor scores. We developed a new information-theoretic algorithm, named âPlexyâ, which represents a high-quality alignment as one that reduces the structural perplexity between their coordinates (Supplementary Methods). The smaller this value, the more likely it is that one can âguessâ the coordinates of one structure knowing the coordinates of the other. Plotting structural perplexity from ORF2p RT for this set (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 12b,c and 13) showed that it recapitulates close relationships between ORF2p, R2Bm and group II introns, and that ânegative controlâ proteins have extremely high perplexities from ORF2p. To better understand relationships between full-length ORF2p and other proteins, we computed the pairwise structural distances across all pairs of proteins and normalized them with respect to the size of the two proteins and their alignment, anchoring the plot on the ORF2p crystal structure (Supplementary Methods, Fig. 5e). Across both datasets, proteins in the same functional class typically clustered together in an unsupervised manner, with R2Bm and group II introns again closest to ORF2p. Group IIB introns are thought to be evolutionarily closer to L1 than group IIC, but intriguingly both have similar perplexities from ORF2p with subtle differences in subdomains, highlighting structural conservation (Supplementary Fig. 13). Domesticated cellular RTs were next closest to ORF2p RT, but normalized distances between full-length ORF2p and Prp8 and TERT were larger owing to the incorporation of unrelated structural elements (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Viral RdRps such as HCV and influenza B have remarkable similarity to ORF2p RT30; non-LTR and viral RTs are more distant. Notably, the inactive p51 HIV-1/2 RT subunit was predicted to be far more distant to ORF2p than the active p66 HIV-1/2 RT, despite identical amino acid sequence (up to a deletion). Therefore, this analytical framework quantifies conformational similarity in a manner that is sensitive to function."
38096902_052,PMC10830420,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
38096902_053,PMC10830420,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our integrated analyses reveal the inner workings of the molecular machine that has written nearly half of the human genome. Understanding L1 structure and function is important both in evolution and, increasingly, in human disease. Accumulating evidence links L1 activity and the host response to common pathologies including cancer, ageing, neurodegeneration and autoimmunity2â7,26,27. Our biochemical, structural and evolutionary analyses show that ORF2p contains a highly active polymerase that is uniquely adapted for its parasitic replication cycle, with both conserved and new structural features that preserve optimal retrotransposition throughout evolution. Together, these data provide insights into two key underlying mechanisms through which L1 may cause disease: (1) nuclear insertional mutagenesis and resultant genomic havoc, and (2) cytosolic sensing of the products of ORF2p reverse transcription."
38096902_054,PMC10830420,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although nuclear L1 activity has been correlated with DNA damage and structural genomic rearrangements2,41,42,52, a mechanistic understanding of L1 insertion has been elusive. The insertion process can be understood as two half reactions: first and second strand synthesis. Second strand synthesis has been challenging to study, and it was unclear whether it is performed by L1 or the host. Our data demonstrate that ORF2p is competent to perform all enzymatic steps required to prime and execute both first and second strand syntheses: it effectively synthesizes DNA with short RNA or DNA primers on both RNA and DNA templates (Fig. 3, Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Figs. 3â5). Interpreting our results in the context of high-quality biochemical data from decades of studying the R2 LINEs in insects21,24,36,48 provides us with the opportunity to update the L1 insertion model (Fig. 6). The mechanism describes a canonical insertion that is intentionally simplified and omits numerous supportive and repressive host proteins, including topoisomerase TOP1, PARP1, purine-rich element binding proteins, the Fanconi pathway (including BRCA1) and p53 (refs. 8,17â19). Furthermore, alternative pathways as such host-catalysed second strand synthesis may occur in different contexts or following ORF2p failure, and the host may combat insertion by, for example, cleaving intermediates.Fig. 6Revised L1 insertion model.a, ORF2p bound to target DNA as TPRT begins, drawn schematically with linear target DNA for clarity as in the models below. b, ORF2p in complex during first strand synthesis. It seems more likely that ORF2p bends the target DNA around the highly positively charged âbackâ face of the polymerase (Extended Data Fig. 9); it can then pass through the PCNA ring clamp, which binds to the PIP box and recruits RNase H2 (ref. 29). c, Revised insertion model. Activities supporting steps 4, 5, 7 and 8 are demonstrated here. 1. ORF2p EN cuts target DNA, liberating a gDNA 3â²-OH 2. TPRT: the T-rich gDNA primer is passed into the RT active site, where it base pairs with the poly(A) tail of the bound template, and the 3â²-OH is extended. 3. First strand synthesis generates a large (6âkb) cDNA loop; RNase H2, recruited by ORF2pâPCNA, can begin. 4. NTA, in which extra bases are added to the 3â² cDNA end beyond the 5â² end of the RNA template, may occur. 5. Template jumping or switching to the exposed single-stranded gDNA may follow, potentially facilitated by microhomology from NTA nucleotides and the 5â² cap. This would also release 5â² phosphate-bound EN to ârock and rollâ20,24,48 to carry out: 6. The second EN (staggered) cut, which liberates the 3â² OH used to prime second strand synthesis; a stagger from the first cut of approximately 12â18âbp results in characteristic target site duplications (TSDs)20,21,24,44. 7. Strand transfer and priming of second strand synthesis. 8. Second strand synthesis using the 6âkb L1 cDNA as template. RNase H2 activity may also occur here. 9. Ligation and end repair, resulting in a completed approximately 6âkb insertion flanked by TSDs. The second EN cleavage may sometimes occur in the absence of a template jump. b, Â© 2023 JHUAAM.

38096902_055,PMC10830420,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our data also shed light on other areas of the canonical L1 replication cycle. ORF2p cis RNA binding is thought to occur at the ribosome53,54. Newly translated apo ORF2p is unstable until RNA is bound, and it assumes a âthumb upâ conformation competent to tightly bind RNA; we speculate that the initial RNA binding probably occurs cotranslationally, potentially before the CTD has even been translated. PCNA binding, which is required for retrotransposition17 and recruits RNase H2 to allow second strand cleavage29, does not seem to be occluded in any identified state; this, together with EN and RT dependence17,18, indicates that PCNA may be recruited to ORF2p by the developing genomic lesion. Most new LINE insertions are heavily 5â² truncated1; often they comprise only a few hundred base pairs, but the reasons are not well understood. ORF2p is efficient and highly processive, consistent with previous observations16,32, adding support to the idea that host cleavage of the L1 RNA or intermediates is more likely to cause 5â² truncation than inefficiency of the polymerase55. Nuclear ORF1p levels are limited17,18, and bound ORF1p chaperones would be displaced from L1 RNA during RT, potentially leaving the large single-stranded cDNA loop intermediate unprotected (steps 3â7, Fig. 6). This could represent both a unique vulnerability and a potential nidus for translocations41,42,52, given its homology to much of the genome."
38096902_056,PMC10830420,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Cytosolic double-stranded nucleic acids, viral mimicry and resultant interferon signalling are known to contribute to pathology in several contexts, and NRTIs have been shown to limit the production of interferon and ofÂ these nucleic acids6,7, but their origin has remained controversial. First, our data show that ORF2p can use RNA primers and short RNA hairpins to initiate RT reactions; an Alu-like sequence is readily extended, and uridylation of the L1 RNA56 might convert it into a similar substrate as well. RNA priming of ORF2p RT in the cytoplasm can parsimoniously explain the origin of these nucleic acids. We also show that DNA primers as short as 5ânt can prime L1; it is possible that shorter primers are also tolerated16. Second, we demonstrate that L1 can directly synthesize RNA:DNA hybrids in the cytosol; these are RT-dependent but EN-independent, ruling out a nuclear origin in this system. Third, we show that L1 synthesized cDNAs activate cGAS/STING, resulting in interferon production. Our observations further demonstrate the potentially critical role of L1 and its RT products in viral mimicry57,58, as inferred from genome and cancer evolution59,60. Moreover, our robust inhibitor data provide a framework for evaluating the involvement of L1 in these phenotypes and for targeting this in the future. In summary, our structural elucidation of ORF2p will facilitate rational design of new therapeutics and lays the groundwork for future studies needed to dissect and improve our understanding of the insertion mechanism of L1, its evolution and its roles in disease."

Derepression of genomic L1s results in Pol II transcription and export of the L1 RNA, which is translated to form an RNP complex containing one copy ORF2p, a multifunctional enzyme, and many copies of ORF1p, a homotrimeric chaperone involved in nuclear entry that can form phase-separated granules. Canonically, in the nucleus, ORF2p integrates a new copy of the L1 RNA into the genome in a mechanism termed TPRT, in which cleavage by the L1 EN liberates a genomic DNA (gDNA) 3â²-OH used to prime reverse transcription of the L1 RNA, followed by insertion by poorly understood mechanisms (âDiscussionâ, Fig. 6). Non-canonical outcomes contribute to pathology: failed insertions and aberrant EN activity result in DNA damage and translocations, and aberrant cytosolic RT activity generates inflammatory RNA:DNA hybrids. Host proteins (not shown) are associated at every step and may repress L1 or function as essential cofactors. c, Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of pure, monodisperse 97âkDa ORF2p core after size exclusion chromatography. d, Two newÂ domains (tower and wrist) and three canonical RT subdomains (fingers, palm, thumb) coordinate with a hybrid duplex RNA template (purple) and DNA primer (cyan) and incoming dTTP nucleotide (yellow) for ORF2p core RT activity in the 2.1âÃ resolution crystal structure in a âright-handâ RT fold that is uniquely adapted.

38096902_066,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,title_2,Supplementary Background and Discussion
38096902_067,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,paragraph,"A large fraction of eukaryotic genomes consists of mobile elements: sequences that either encode protein machinery to mediate their propagation or co-opt other mobile element proteins to copy themselves. DNA cut and paste transposons, like the maize elements discovered by Barbara McClintock78, are no longer active in primates. Instead, recent primate evolution is dominated by RNA copy and paste retrotransposons, in which RNA intermediates are integrated into the genome by encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) activity79. These are divided into two classes: (1) long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, also called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), similar to HIV-1 but no longer thought active in humans, and (2) active Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) non-LTR retrotransposons80-82. Previously considered junk DNA, L1 is the only active protein- coding human transposon and is an important endogenous mutagen82. L1 encodes two proteins, open reading frame 1 protein (ORF1p), a homotrimeric chaperone likely involved in nuclear entry83-87, and ORF2p, which has endonuclease (EN) and RT activities88-90 and three additional domains with previously unknown functions. Both L1 proteins, but especially ORF2p, bind back to the L1 RNA that encodes them, a property termed cis preference 83,91-96. Indeed, ORF2p is thought to bind to its encoding RNA co-translationally91,96 and most ORF2p is thought to be bound to the L1 RNA poly(A) tail83,97-99. Cis preference is not perfect, however, and ORF2p will copy and insert any bound RNA, including cellular mRNA sequences and RNAs transcribed from Short INterspersed Element (SINE) sequences Alu and SVA (SINE/variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)/Alu). Alu SINEs have specific mechanisms of hijacking ORF2p at the ribosome91. Together, the molecular fossil record of these sequences comprises about a third of the genome81,100,101. L1s are conserved to plants and thus L1s and their hosts have been co-evolving for 1-2 billion years102 in an arms race: the transposon attempts to copy itself in a process called retrotransposition (Fig. 1a), while the host defends against this mutagenic process. Multi-layered host defenses recognize the L1 DNA and RNA sequences, proteins, and retrotransposition intermediates, notably including p53103, which may have evolved to suppress mobile elements83,92,103-108. Numerous additional studies have contributed to knowledge that de-repressed L1 elements can contribute to human pathology through at least three distinct mechanisms: (1) DNA damage from insertions, abortive insertions, and aberrant L1 EN activity104,106,109-112, (2) perturbation of cellular homeostasis in response to L1 activation104,105,111, and (3) sterile inflammation (viral mimicry) mediated by sensing of RT products (Fig. 1b)104,113-116. Key additional studies have implicated L1 in autoimmunity including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sj&ouml;gren s syndrome (SS), and psoriasis, neurodegeneration, and age-related macular degenartion117-120. In cancer, additional studies contributed to the concepts of viral mimicry and the p53-L1 relationship121-126. Accordingly, RT inhibitors have shown promising results in numerous model systems113,114,117,118,127,128, and a number of studies have shown inhibition of L1 retrotransposition by NRTIs in cells129-133. In contrast with HIV-1 RT, where high resolution structural understanding has led to evidence-based therapy134-137, limited understanding of L1 ORF2p structure and function has restricted rational inhibitor development and dissection of the underlying pathophysiology. Biochemically, non-templated addition is also seen in retroviral RTs138, and the 5 RNA cap may facilitate this activity as well as base pairing to facilitate template switching or jumping139. In R2 these activities are partially understood mechanistically and structurally140-142. These activities are likely involved in the transition from first to second strand synthesis (Discussion). The equivalent tower lock region in R2 as that in ORF2p was previously shown to contact RNA143, although R2 does not have a tower and the baseplate does not have a PCNA-binding PIP box. PCNA recruits RNase H2 for efficient L1 retrotransposition144; RNase H2 is mutated in the Mendelian interferonopathy Aicardi Goutières Syndrome144, and these patients respond clinically to RT inhibitors145."

Cells were lysed in a microfluidizer (Microfluidics) in 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, 25 mM Imidazole, and 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, purified by Ni-NTA and heparin affinity, tag cleaved using 3C protease, protease removed using heparin affinity, and polished using size exclusion on a Superdex 200 column (Cytiva) in SEC buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0) with monodisperse fractions corresponding to the theoretical mobility of a monomer at 97 kDa. Mutant and subsequent WT ORF2p core proteins were purified similarly but with C-terminal His8 and lacking the N-terminal MBP. For crystallography, ORF2p-His8 core was purified as above but the final size exclusion polishing step used low-salt SEC buffer (150 mM NaCl instead of 500 mM) and the pooled fractions were concentrated to 5-6mg/ml, aliquoted and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Full-length ORF2p (1-1275) using a codon-optimized ORFeus-Hs sequence148 and a C- terminal 3C-3xFlag tag92 was cloned into a customized insect vector pDARMO-PolH2.1 (pMT692)149, expressed in SF9 insect cells using the MultiBac EMBacY system150(Geneva Biotech), purified by Flag and Heparin affinity, and polished on size exclusion on a Superdex 200 column (Cytiva) in SEC buffer, with monodisperse fractions corresponding to the theoretical mobility of a monomer at ~150 kDa used for further structural experiments. For single nucleotide gel-based assays, HIV and HERV-K RTs were expressed and purified from SF9 insect cells using the MultiBac system, as previously reported151; full-length ORF2p with C-terminal His8 tag was expressed and purified analogously, as a fusion polyprotein containing N-terminal HERV-K and TEV proteases followed by TEV cleavage site (ENLYFQG) to facilitate post-translational processing, which results in a single glycine residue at the N terminus."

The resulting complex was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and used to set up a range of commercial sparse matrix crystallization screens. The initial hit was obtained in Proplex screen (Molecular Dimensions), condition D7 (0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.5 and 15% PEG6000). These crystals were small, soft, difficult to handle and only diffracted to ~3.7 &Aring; resolution, and data were also highly anisotropic. Sequential grid- screen optimizations were conducted to optimize pH, PEG molecular weight, PEG concentration and protein:well solution mixing ratio. Different combinations of organic solvents and salts were also extensively screened both as crystallization additives and in combination with additional PEG as post-growth order enhancement systems. The final crystals used to generate the data presented here were grown from 18% PEG8000, 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6, 0.2 M NaCl, 10% DMSO and 5% 1,4-dioxane. For data collection, crystallization drops were layered with stabilizing solution (27.5% PEG8000, 20% DMSO, 0.05 M sodium citrate pH5.6) and incubated for 1 hour prior to harvesting by immersion in liquid nitrogen.

Purified full-length ORF2p and ORF2p core in SEC Buffer were crosslinked using BS3 (bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate; ThermoFisher Scientific, #21580), with and without the addition of DNA:RNA hybrid, using a final protein concentration of 1 g/ L in 500 mM NaCl (and 2.7 mM HEPES pH 8, 0.7% glycerol (v/v), 0.07 mM TCEP, 0.27 mM MgCl2). To the samples containing DNA:RNA, the hybrid was at 1.5:1 molar ratio to ORF2p, with 2 mM dTTP. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hour on ice, prior to initiating crosslinking. BS3 solutions were prepared at different concentrations and added to the reaction mixtures accordingly, which were agitated in a thermal mixer at 750 RPM, 23 &deg;C for 3 min. Crosslinking reactions were quenched by adding Tris to a final concentration of 100 mM from a stock solution of 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Tris pH 8.0, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. For tryptic digestion and sample cleanup prior to LC-MS/MS analysis, the quenched crosslinking reactions were first dried down using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator.

For precursor peptides and fragmentation detection on the mass spectrometer, MS1 survey scans (m/z 375 to 1500) were performed at a resolution of 120,000 with a 300% normalized AGC target. Peptide precursors from charge states 2-6 were sampled for MS2 using DDA. For MS2 scan properties, HCD was used, and the fragments were analyzed in the Orbitrap with a collisional energy of 30%, resolution of 15,000, standard AGC target, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. RAW data was searched using pLink 2.3.9164, MaxLynx (MaxQuant 2.1.4.0)165, and Proteome Discoverer 2.4 with the XlinkX plugin166. Among the search parameters, a maximum of three missed cleavages were allowed, and a static modification on cysteines corresponding to thiomethylation by MMTS. The max false discovery rate was set to 1%. Crosslinks found in automated searches were manually validated by inspecting MS2 spectra signal-to-noise and percentage of b and y fragments detected (Supplementary Table 1). Concentrations of BS3 crosslinker were 10 and 30 &micro;M for ORF2p core and 30 and 100 &micro;M for full-length ORF2p.

A particles from subset of 2000 micrographs were picked using cryoSPARC blob picker and subjected to reference free 2D classification. The consistent classes from 2D classification were used as templates for template-based picking on all micrographs, with picked particles subjected to reference free 2D classification. Particles from self-consistent classes were selected and subjected to ab initio model generation and then three rounds of heterogenous refinement. The highest quality reconstruction, comprising 255,612 particles, was subset and refined using non-homogenous refinement172, resulting in a reconstruction at 3.49 &Aring; resolution.

38096902_111,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,paragraph,"We manually curated a set of 50 experimental protein structures which contained RTs, RdRps, a DdRp, a dual DdRp/RdRp, and a number of controls which should have little resemblance to the other proteins. For RT and RT-like proteins, the polypeptide with polymerase activity is used; for other proteins, the entire biological assembly is used. The curated list is available in Supplementary Table 3. We utilized the MMLigner software version 1.0.2191 to compute the alignments, enforcing the Maximum-Fragment Pair (MFP) library to have a maximum value of 5000 MFPs as we observed that for large structures, such as ORF2p (1275 amino acids in length). The default pruning was insufficient and additional pruning was required for significant alignments to be obtained. Additionally, we enforced that two proteins with no residue alignments should each contribute their null contributions. The efficiency of an alignment can be determined via the compression for a given alignment,: Here, positive values indicate that the message length with the alignment,, is shorter than the message length without the alignment, for two sets of protein coordinates (and). Negative values indicate the alignment is inefficient, which could result from an alignment with large coverage but poor quality. A value of zero indicates that there is no difference with respect to the message length without the alignment. The null model is encoded in two parts -- a radial part and a directional part: The radius is encoded with a normal distribution around 3.8 angstroms with a standard deviation of 0.4 angstroms. The direction is encoded with a 23-component Kent distribution which parameterizes the angular coordinates of an alpha carbon. If there is a significant alignment, the information content required to encode two proteins is smaller as the entropy of the second protein s coordinates is smaller than that of the null distribution. The updated radial and angular probability distributions will depend on the alignment: The radial component is transmitted over a distribution with three degrees of freedom (). This constrains the coordinates of protein 2 () to the coordinates of protein 1 (). The directional component is transmitted using Bayesian updating of the components of the Kent distribution. We can define an evolutionary distance based on the compression derived from an alignment, using an algorithm we term Plexy. We compute the perplexity of the compressed information as follows: Therefore, increased compression results in a smaller distance, and negative compression results in larger distances. This offers advantages over other metrics such as RMSD as this term inherently takes into account the quality and the length of an alignment. We conducted pairwise structural alignments against all proteins within the curated list. We next desired to illustrate these pairwise distances on a two-dimensional plane. To do so, we computed the perplexity from the Normalized Compression Distance196. The Normalized Compression Distance is computed as: This is an approximation of Kolmogrov complexity. The normalized perplexity is then: We projected these distances using multi-dimensional scaling using the Python scikit-learn package197."

38096902_122,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,paragraph,"a, ORFp core utilizes both RNA:DNA and DNA:DNA template:primer system for DNA synthesis at similar levels regardless of DNA or RNA nature of the template. While patterns of DNA synthesis differ slightly depending on the nature of the template, ORF2p is agnostic about the 3 end of the template:primer pair, showing no difference between a blunt template or a 3 overhang. b, Denaturing PAGE migration pattern of the reaction products of the time course of dNTP incorporation along DNA and RNA templates using 20-nucleotide (nt) DNA or RNA primers. ORF2p core functions as an efficient DNA polymerase on all template:primer combinations. RNA priming on an RNA template is reduced but remains significant, with shows time-dependent formation of the full template-length (FTL) reaction products, more evident on the long exposure (below). For sequencing gel polymerase assays, ORF2p core was pre-incubated with pre-annealed template and labeled primer in EDTA-containing buffer and DNA synthesis was initiated by the addition of MgCl2. Zero reaction lanes (left and right most) illustrates the migration pattern of template:primer pairs in the absence of reaction. FTL (41 nt) and primer (20 nt) are indicated. Non-templated addition of nucleotides (NTA) is marked by plus (+) and template jumping/switching products are labeled with hashes (##). RNA primers migrate slower than DNA primers on the denaturing PAGE due to differences in charge-to-mass ratio, and the denaturing conditions (95&deg;C, formamide, 8 M urea) do not fully denature the RNA primer/RNA template. Scanned gel images are cropped and corrected for distortion artifacts with contrast uniformly increased to facilitate the visualization of minor products. c, RNA synthesis is strongly selected against, as indicated by nucleotide (dNTP or NTP) incorporation activity of LINE-1 RT on DNA or RNA using a RNA primer.

38096902_124,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,paragraph,"Template jumping/switching activity (schematic inset) entails continued cDNA synthesis after the end of a first template has been reached by incorporation of a second acceptor template, resulting in a product that is a concatemer of two templates (or more, with repeated events)142,193. Template jumping and switching are similar but differ in that template jumps are facilitated by short (1-3 nt) microhomology that may be created by NTA, whereas template switches are blunt139-141,194. This activity for ORF2p is confirmed by Sanger sequencing-like reactions, where in vitro polymerase reactions were conducted on DNA:DNA template:primers for 1 min and then continued for 5 min in 100-fold excess chain terminating dideoxy nucleotides (ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, ddGTP, d4T) as indicated. Complete Sanger sequencing of previously observed high molecular weight products confirms these do represent bona fide template jumps. Expected incorporation positions for ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, ddGTP and subsequent terminations for the first template (bottom) and second template (top) after template jumping are annotated and enlarged in inset. ORF2p core was preincubated with a template:primer for one minute at 37 &deg;C with a dNTP mixture 1 uM supplemented with 100 uM ddNTP as labelled in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH8) buffer, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.25 mM EDTA. Addition of d4T-TP, which is incorporated similarly to ddTTP, confirms the specificity of incorporation.

38096902_142,PMC10830420,SUPPLEMENT,paragraph,"The seven domains and subdomains of ORF2p are plotted relative to the set of 50 proteins and to each other. Where available, both the crystal coordinates and those from AlphaFold2 were compared (ORF2-crystal-full is 238-1061; ORF2-full-AF is 1-1275, etc.). Proteins with perplexity < 10-20 are shown; above this value, in most groups the other protein classes, which may generally be viewed as decoys start to score. Outside of this to ORF2p itself, the EN, tower, and wrist domains all have no significant hits in this set; CTD has very weak similarity to TERT and the Group IIB intron from Thermosynechococcus vestitus. The ancestral palm subdomain has very low perplexity with many polymerases in the set and recapitulates many of the relationships seen with the full crystal structure: ORF2p palm is predicted to be most similar to the other non-LTR transposon, R2Bm, followed by Group II mobile introns, HCV and influenza RdRPs, and domesticated cellular RTs, including PRP8 and TERT, followed more distantly by retroviral RTs. Again, the inactive p51 conformations of HIV-1/2 RT are predicted to be much more distant from ORF2p than the active p66 conformations, which are identical in sequence up to a deletion. The fingers and then thumb subdomains are each predicted to be less similar than palm to smaller numbers of these proteins, but in roughly similar orders, although interestingly in the thumb R2Bm is predicted to be slightly less similar to ORF2p than some of the evolutionarily more distant proteins such as TERT and Group II introns."

36542723_006,PMC9770967,INTRO,title_1,INTRODUCTION
36542723_007,PMC9770967,INTRO,paragraph,"Quantitative high-throughput (HTP) approaches are needed to explore the human protein-protein affinity interactome (1 â 3)â. Commonly, protein complexes are identified from cellular extracts with pull-downâbased approaches involving a bait immobilized on beads via antibodies (immunoprecipitation) or affinity tags (affinity purification). Protein complexes are then purified from cell extracts on the beads by applying extensive washing protocols that reduce nonspecific background stepwise while retaining the bound specific interaction partners (4, 5). Other methods used for HTP discovery of protein complexes are based on two-hybrid screens, the cofractionation of molecular assemblies, display technologies, or the irreversible modification of proteins found in close proximity, and are often coupled to a pull-downâbased approach (6 â 10)â. All these methods are powerful, yet they remain qualitative and do not shed light on the biophysical attributes underpinning the observed interactions, such as dissociation constants (K d)."
36542723_008,PMC9770967,INTRO,paragraph,"Molecules neither âinteractâ nor ânot interact.â Rather, their interactions follow physical rules. For example, the law of mass action in binding equilibrium defines the degree of complex formation as a function of binding affinities and cellular concentrations. Quantitative assays aiming to measure binding affinities at HTP are mostly limited to fragmentomic approaches, where interactions are studied between minimal binding fragments, most usually between globular domains and peptide motifs. Most recently, we characterized tens of thousands of domain-motif affinities using the holdup assay, a single-point binding experiment that measures the degree of complex formation under equilibrium (11, 12)â. These and other recent advances brought proteome-wide fragmentomic affinity screening of elementary reactions within reach (13 â 16)â. However, fragmentomic approaches do not reveal how affinities change when minimal binding fragments are embedded in the full-length proteins or even larger macromolecular complexes."
36542723_009,PMC9770967,INTRO,paragraph,"As a solution, we developed the quantitative native holdup (nHU) assay to estimate binding affinities of full-length proteins directly from native cell extracts. We demonstrate that nHU can be coupled to various protein analytical methods, such as Western blot (WB) or mass spectrometry (MS), exploiting all advances of protein analytics. We explore the interactions of Sorting Nexin 27 (SNX27), a component of the retromer complex involved in the endosome-to-plasma membrane protein recycling (17, 18)â. We find that the nHU assay provides robust estimations about apparent equilibrium binding constants over a wide affinity range. We show that nHU and fragmentomics are highly complementary as affinities measured with these approaches are related but not necessarily identical since apparent binding properties of full-length proteins can be modulated by many phenomena, such as multivalency or conformational heterogeneity."
36542723_010,PMC9770967,RESULTS,title_1,RESULTS
36542723_011,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"In a holdup experiment, an analyte solution is incubated with either control or bait-saturated resin, and the differential depletion of prey protein within the liquid phase fraction is measured with analytical methods to calculate the equilibrium binding constant (11, 12, 19)â. We used streptavidin resin saturated with biotinylated peptides or proteins as baits and biotin or biotinylated-maltose-binding protein (MBP) as controls. The saturated resin is equilibrated with the analyte, and the liquid phase is rapidly separated from the resin either by fast filtration or by pipetting the supernatant after a brief centrifugation. The unbound prey fraction is quantified by the relative prey concentration between bait and control samples, and the complementary bound prey fraction, conventionally called binding intensity (BI), is determined as follows BI = 1 â C free prey (measured in bait experiment) C total prey (measured in control experiment) (1)"
36542723_012,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"In nHU, total cell extracts are used as an analyte, and BI values of preys are measured with quantitative protein analytical methods, such as WB or MS (Fig.Â 1A) (19, 20)â. While the qualitative proof of concept of nHU was demonstrated before, here, we develop it into a quantitative assay (19)â. Cell extracts contain thousands of distinct preys, all present at very low concentrations. We assume that the immobilized bait is in large excess relative to its potential preys in the extract so that even the cumulative amount of bound prey fractions should occupy only a negligible fraction of the immobilized bait. Together, the apparent equilibrium constants for interactions following a simple bimolecular binding mechanism can be calculated using the hyperbolic binding equation K app = C bait â C bait â BI BI (2)"
36542723_013,PMC9770967,RESULTS,fig_caption,"Fig.Â 1.: Principle and simple demonstration of nHU. (A) Schematic pipeline of nHU. Biotinylated baits and controls are immobilized on streptavidin resin at high concentration and are mixed with cellular extracts. After the binding equilibrium is reached, the liquid phase is separated by filtration or by centrifugation, and amounts of prey proteins are determined using standard protein analytical tools, such as WB or MS. The measured concentration ratio, in combination with the estimated amount of the immobilized bait concentration can be directly converted into apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (pK app). Note that the discarded resin from step 3 can be optionally processed as a regular pull-down experiment. (B) Demonstration of nHU titration experiment using the biotinylated PBM peptide of DGKZ as bait and biotin as control. Increasing amounts of bait-saturated resins were incubated with total Jurkat extracts. Supernatant fractions were probed with specific antibodies against endogenous full-length PDZ domainâcontaining proteins SCRIB and SNX27. (C) Results of nHU-WB experiments presented in (B). BI values of SNX27 (green, left) and SCRIB (red, right) were first fitted with a hyperbolic binding equation (dashed line). In the case of SCRIB, a significantly better fit was obtained using the Hill equation (red dashed line) compared to a hyperbolic binding equation (gray dashed line). Determined parameters are indicated below the plots. BI values were determined on the basis of three replicates. See fig. S1 and table S1 for additional data."
36542723_014,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"Through the study, we will report apparent affinities as negative logarithmic dissociation constant values (hence, pK appÂ =Â 6 corresponds to K appÂ =Â 1 Î¼M, pK appÂ =Â 5 corresponds to K appÂ =Â 10 Î¼M, etc.). The accuracy of the calculated affinities depends on the accuracy of the estimation of the concentration of the immobilized bait (C bait). This concentration needs to be higher than the cumulative concentration of all prey molecules of the extract that are prone to be captured by the bait. Previously, we determined the binding capacity of streptavidin resin (Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance, Cytiva) for various ligands by substituting affinities measured with orthogonal methods in binding equations, such as Eq. 2. As a rule of thumb, if 50 Î¼l of bait-saturated streptavidin resin is mixed with 200 Î¼l of extract, the estimated C bait is between 5 and 20 Î¼M, most likely around 10 Î¼M (12, 21)â."
36542723_015,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"To investigate whether nHU can be used to measure affinities of a full-length protein directly from a cell extract, we addressed an already described interaction between the PDZ-binding motif (PBM) peptide of diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKZ) and full-length SNX27 endogenously present in Jurkat extract (22)â. First, we saturated streptavidin resin with biotin or biotinylated peptide. Then, we incubated total Jurkat cell extracts with various mixes of control and bait-saturated resin by keeping the resin/analyte ratio constant. This way, the concentration of SNX27 is fixed (determined by the lysate), whereas the concentration of the immobilized DGKZ peptide covers a wide range of concentration (23, 24)â. The supernatant fractions of each experiment were assayed by WB using a specific antibody against SNX27 (Fig.Â 1B and fig. S1A). As expected, the measured BI values of SNX27 decreased when C bait was decreased, following the hyperbolic binding equation (Eq. 2), revealing an apparent affinity of 6.4 pK app (Fig.Â 1C, left, and table S1). This interaction between the PBM peptide of DGKZ and the isolated PDZ domain of SNX27 was already studied by both calorimetry and fragmentomic holdup, and the affinities were found to be 5.7 and 6.0 pK d, respectively (12, 22)â. Thus, we found nHU to be a robust and versatile method for estimating biophysical properties of an endogenous full-length protein directly from cellular extract."
36542723_016,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"Titration experiments are key for investigating precise binding mechanism. However, they come with low throughput and high experimental cost. For this reason, we used single-point holdup experiments to measure apparent affinities of thousands of fragmentomic interactions at HTP in our previous study (12)â. Similarly, we propose that nHU experiments can also be performed using a single-bait concentration to probe binding equilibrium by assuming the binding mechanism. We used 12 different biotinylated 10-mer PBM peptides as baits or biotin as a negative control and performed nHU at a single-bait concentration (10 Î¼M) using total Jurkat extracts as analyte (Fig.Â 2A and fig. S1B). We measured the depletion of SNX27 from the supernatants using nHU coupled to WB (nHU-WB), and the binding intensities of the PBM baits were converted into affinities using Eq. 2. The resulting affinities between full-length SNX27 and the 12 peptide baits showed excellent agreement with their fragmentomic affinities measured with the isolated PDZ domain of SNX27 with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.95 (Fig.Â 2B, left, and table S1) (12)â."
36542723_017,PMC9770967,RESULTS,fig_caption,"Fig.Â 2.: Single-point nHU for rapid apparent affinity measurements. (A) Demonstration of single-point nHU-WB using 12 different biotinylated PBM peptides (baits) or biotin (control) saturated streptavidin resin and total Jurkat extracts. Supernatant fractions were probed with specific antibodies against endogenous full-length PDZ domainâcontaining proteins SCRIB and SNX27. (B) Results of the nHU-WB experiment presented in (A). Correlation between in vitro fragmentomic affinities measured using PBM peptides and isolated PDZ domains (12)â and apparent affinities measured with nHU between PBM peptides and full-length proteins. In the case of SCRIB (right), the site-specific fragmentomic affinities were combined assuming simple additivity. Direct proportionality was assumed between affinities (gray dashed line), and the coefficient of proportionality (k), coefficient of determination (R 2) values, and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) values are indicated. Note the negative R 2 value in the case of SCRIB, which indicates that a better fit could be obtained with a model with nonzero intercept; however, the physical basis of such model would be difficult to justify. Affinities were determined on the basis of three replicates. See fig. S1 and table S1 for additional data."
36542723_018,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"However, not all interactions follow a simple binding mechanism (25)â. For example, Scribble (SCRIB) contains four PDZ domains that can synergize for the binding to PBMs, leading to interactions that are neither bimolecular nor single-sited. In addition to SNX27, we also measured the depletion of endogenous full-length SCRIB in the previous nHU-WB experiments. In the titration experiment, the affinity between the DGKZ peptide and full-length endogenous SCRIB was found to be more than an order of magnitude stronger than any of the site-specific affinities of its isolated domains (6.4 pK app versus 5.1, 4.9, 4.7, and 4.4 pK d) (Fig.Â 1C, right, and table S1) (26)â. We also found that the interaction displays negative cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 0.6 (27)â. Consequently, neither single-point holdup experiments nor Eq. 2 could reveal site-specific affinities of SCRIB with absolute confidence. Still, they could be used to calculate apparent affinities for ranking different interaction partners. Site-specific fragmentomic affinities can be combined to approximate an additive affinity of all interaction sites (12)â. Despite these rough approximations, a good correlation (PCCÂ =Â 0.81) was found between the apparent affinities measured by single-point nHU and the combined fragmental affinities (Fig.Â 2B, right, and table S1). In addition, these single-point nHU experiments indicated that avidity between functional sites is markedly stronger when more isolated sites show detectable binding. In the case of motifs that show detectable binding with less than three isolated PDZ domains of SCRIB, calculated additive affinities were found to be systematically stronger than apparent affinities measured by nHU, possibly due to the negative cooperativity between the domains of SCRIB (fig. S2). In contrast, in motifs that show detectable binding with more than two isolated PDZ domains of SCRIB, calculated additive affinities were found to be weaker than the apparent affinities measured by nHU, indicating a large avidity between the binding sites. Still, single-point nHU experiments were found to be robust to explore intrinsic properties of a large number of interactions regardless of their binding mechanisms."
36542723_019,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"We coupled nHU to label-free quantitative MS to measure affinities of the SNX27 PDZ domain (SNX27_PDZ) for all the proteins quantifiable within a given cellular extract (Fig.Â 3A and table S1). The isolated PDZ domain fused to a biotinylated-His6-MBP tag was used as the bait, and the biotinylated-His6-MBP tag alone served as a control. To show the enrichment of preys that were depleted from the supernatant on the solid phase, the leftover resin after nHU was further processed according to a standard affinity-purification (AP) pull-down protocol (Fig.Â 3B)."

36542723_021,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"We performed the nHU experiment using Jurkat cell extracts and assayed affinities of 3182 full-length endogenous proteins, of which 51 showed statistically significant depletion, most of which were also enriched on the resins in the pull-down assay (Fig.Â 3, A to C). In cases where there was a discrepancy between nHU coupled to MS (nHU-MS) and AP-MS, many false-positive preys of AP-MS showed no significant depletion in nHU, and similarly, many false-negative preys of AP-MS showed no significant enrichment during pull-down. We also repeated the experiment series using SH-SY5Y cell extracts and probed the affinities of 2076 full-length endogenous proteins, of which 83 showed statistically significant depletion (Fig.Â 3D and fig S3A). The determined apparent affinities for the 13 interaction partners of SNX27_PDZ that we quantified from both cell extracts were directly proportional with a PCC of 0.86 (Fig.Â 3E)."
36542723_022,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further establish the repeatability and robustness of the nHU-MS assay, we repeated the experiments using a different mass spectrometer and six different PDZ domain baits taken from SCRIB (PDZ_1 and PDZ_2), discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1 (DLG1, PDZ_1, and PDZ_2), Tax1 binding protein 3 (TAX1BP3), and SNX27 (fig. S3B and table S1). Using total Jurkat extract, we assayed 5595 endogenous proteins against these baits and identified 141 proteins that showed detectable interaction to at least one PDZ domain, and we quantified 198 affinities in total. Affinities measured using the SNX27_PDZ showed good agreement with the previous measurements done using extracts from the same cell type (PCCÂ =Â 0.79, based on 39 common interaction partners) (Fig.Â 3F and table S1). Of the studied baits, the PDZ domain of SNX27 turned out to be the most promiscuous with 103 statistically significant interaction partners (while 180 SNX27 binding partners were identified in total on the basis of the three independent nHU-MS experiments). The other PDZ domains had lower promiscuity, and even the second most promiscuous PDZ domain (TAX1BP3) showed detectable binding with only 33 partners."
36542723_023,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"On the basis of all nHU-MS experiments, 216 proteins showed detectable interaction with at least one PDZ domain, and among these proteins, we identified 102 proteins with putative C-terminal PBMs. In our previous fragmentomic screen, the binding affinities of >400 isolated PBM peptides were already assayed against human PDZ domains (12)â. From the 102 full-length interaction partners found here, the PBMs of 39 had been addressed in our previous fragmentomic screen. Albeit this assay had quantified affinities between isolated PDZ domains and 10-mer C-terminal PBM peptides, they still showed weak correlation with the apparent affinities now measured by single-point nHU-MS with a PCC of 0.37 (fig. S4A and table S1). While some interactions of these isolated PDZ domains displayed very similar affinities when measured as a full-length protein from cellular extract with nHU or as a 10-mer C-terminal fragment, most interactions were found to be stronger in nHU experiments. On average, PDZ domains displayed >3-fold stronger apparent dissociation constants (âpK dÂ âÂ 0.5) when measured against full-length proteins in nHU, as compared to their affinities for isolated PBM fragments."
36542723_024,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"We performed an nHU-MS experiment using total Jurkat extracts as analyte and recombinant full-length SNX27 fused to an N-terminal biotinylated-MBP and C-terminal His6 tag as a bait or biotinylated-His6-MBP tag alone as a control (Fig.Â 4, A and B, and table S1). In addition to the PDZ domain, full-length SNX27 contains a Phox homology and a FERM (4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain. We quantified 3128 full-length endogenous preys, of which 198 showed statistically significant depletion in nHU. Most of these targets were also enriched in a subsequent control pull-down experiment (fig. S3C). Among the interaction partners of SNX27, 32 proteins were also identified in the previous nHU experiments as partners of SNX27_PDZ, including 17 with putative C-terminal PBMs, and the obtained affinities correlate with a PCC of 0.63 (Fig.Â 4C)."

(C) Correlation between apparent affinities of the SNX27_PDZ or full-length SNX27. Affinities of SNX27_PDZ were averaged on the basis of the three independent nHU experiment series.

(D) Coarse topology, measured affinities, and estimated steady state of the SNX-retromer-WASH complex. The two hypothetical topological positions of SNX27 in the complex based on current observations were shown on the opposite sides of the dimeric complex. Measured affinities of SNX27 were combined with estimated total protein concentrations of HEK293T cells [taken from OpenCell (35)â] using the quadratic binding equation to estimate the amount of SNX27-bound complexes. Note that amounts of complexes of the same subcomplexes are in the same regime: ~10 to 15% of the total amount of SNX27 found in HEK293T cells (280 nM) is bound to SNX-BARs, ~5% of SNX27 is bound to retromer, andÂ ~2% of SNX27 is bound to WASH. *Affinity determined for FAM21 showed statistical significance below threshold. **The concentration of WASH2 in HEK293T is unknown and is substituted with the concentration of WASH1. See fig. S3 and table S1 for additional data."
36542723_026,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"Affinities obtained from nHU can originate from either direct or indirect interactions through large complexes (fig. S4B). We identified the retromer complex as an interaction partner of SNX27, with the strongest affinity measured with VPS26B (28, 29)â. We also detected the association of SNX27 and the heterodimeric SNX1/2-SNX5/6 SNX-BAR complex with the strongest affinity measured with SNX1. A short fragment of SNX1/2 was reported to interact with the FERM domain of SNX27 with comparable affinity to the one obtained from nHU (30)â. We identified the actin-regulatory Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and scar homolog (WASH) complex as the partner of SNX27 with the strongest affinities measured with WASH2 and FAM21 (31)â. The 1.5-mDa multi-tRNA synthetase complex cofractionates with the retromer complex in extracts, and we found that all components have detectable affinity with SNX27_PDZ with the strongest interaction with KARS1 (32)â. We identified the 320-kDa BRCC36 isopeptidase (BRISC) complex as a target of SNX27_PDZ with the strongest affinity measured with ABRAXAS2 (33)â. Last, we also detected the oligomeric small guanosine triphosphatase regulator GIT-PIX complex as the interaction partner of SNX27_PDZ with ARHGEF7 (also called Î²-PIX) displaying the strongest affinity (34)â. In the case of the last three complexes, which were identified as the partner of SNX27_PDZ, only the partners with the highest affinities had PBMs satisfying the SNX27_PDZ consensus. These examples may suggest that when large complexes are captured by a bait in nHU assays, the subunit that binds the bait directly displays the strongest measured affinity, while weaker apparent affinities of other subunits can be an asset to map topologies of the complexes."
36542723_027,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"Apparent affinities obtained from nHU experiments can be used to estimate steady states of networks in various conditions by combining with cellular concentrations of proteins. We took apparent affinities between SNX27 and other components of the SNX-retromer-WASH complex and combined them with estimated total protein concentrations measured for human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells using the quadratic binding equation (Fig.Â 4D) (35)â. On the basis of this coarse analysis, 10% of cellular SNX27 is expected to bind to SNX-BARs, 5% to the retromer complex, and 2.5% to the WASH complex in HEK293T cells."
36542723_028,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"For further mechanistic characterization, we selected three representative full-length interaction partners of SNX27 that displayed similar affinities with full-length SNX27 or SNX27_PDZ baits (table S1 and fig. S5). The monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SLC16A1) (36)â and the intermediate filament-forming Vimentin (37)â were among the strongest partners of SNX27, and the neutral amino acid transporter B(0) (SLC1A5) (38)â displayed weaker affinity. In the nHU-MS experiment performed with the six isolated PDZ domains, SLC16A1 and SLC1A5 showed detectable interaction with only SNX27_PDZ, and Vimentin showed detectable interaction with four different PDZ domains, yet SNX27_PDZ was its strongest binder (table S1). To explore the binding mechanisms of their interactions, we performed an nHU-WB titration experiment with full-length SNX27 (Fig.Â 5, fig. S6, and table S1). We have found that SLC1A5 followed a simple binding mechanism (as in Eq. 2). Although SLC16A1 also followed a similar binding mechanism, approximately 10% of the detected protein seemed to be incapable of binding possibly because of regulatory modifications of its C-terminal tail segment. In the case of filamentous Vimentin, we observed a positive cooperative binding mechanism resulting in a stronger SNX27 binding affinity than that approximated from single-point measurements (27)â. However, despite the more complex binding mechanisms of Vimentin and SLC16A1, their apparent affinities estimated from single-point nHU experiments were still indicative of their strong interaction with SNX27. It is worth mentioning that characterizing interactions of full-length transmembrane or filamentous proteins with traditional quantitative biochemical methods is highly challenging yet seems to be easily addressed with nHU."

BI values of all prey were first fitted with a hyperbolic binding equation. In the case of SLC1A5, good fit was achieved with a simple hyperbolic binding equation (yellow dashed line). In the case of SLC16A1, an imperfect fit was achieved with a simple hyperbolic binding equation (gray dashed line), and more accurate fit was found when 10% inactive fraction was assumed (purple dashed line, fÂ =Â 0.9, see Materials and Methods for further details).

36542723_030,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"To investigate whether the observed intrinsic binding properties of the above-investigated interactions lead to the formation of their complex in cells, we measured colocalization (Fig.Â 6 and fig. S7). We immunostained endogenous interaction partners of SNX27 in U2OS cells expressing hemagglutinin (HA)âtagged full-length or truncated SNX27 lacking its PDZ domain (SNX27_ÎPDZ). Both SNX27 constructs were found to be enriched in endomembrane structures. These SNX27 foci were mostly found in the proximity of Vimentin filaments; however, this was found to be independent of the SNX27 PDZ domain possibly because of the endogenous SNX27 background or because of other interactions (Fig.Â 6, E and F). While Vimentin was not enriched in these SNX27 foci, both SLC16A1 and SLC1A5 were (Fig.Â 6, A to D). Moreover, both SLC transporters showed statistically significantly stronger colocalization with SNX27 than with SNX27_ÎPDZ. Therefore, these results indicate that while these two transmembrane SLC transporter proteins are cargos of the SNX27-retromer complex, Vimentin is not and may instead contribute to other activities of the SNX-retromer complex that will require further inspection."

36542723_032,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"Apparent affinities, estimated by either single-point or titration nHU experiments, contain uncertainty from multiple sources. First of all, the relative concentration measurements, which are essential to determine BI values, are affected by the precision of the selected analytical method. For example, the robustness of determined BI values is affected by the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies in nHU-WB experiments or by the abundances and other characteristics of the prey proteins in nHU-MS. While these parameters greatly affect the precision of the assay, the accuracy of converted affinities mostly depend on the bait concentration. Since at the moment, there is no way to measure this parameter experimentally, and we only estimate its value, affinities quantified by nHU should also be considered as estimates. However, affinities measured from the same nHU experiment have a constant bait concentration, and therefore, BI ranking of preys should strictly follow their affinity ranking. Despite this, we have found that we can get a practical estimation of the error of the estimated affinities if we compare results of multiple datasets, e.g., by comparing PCC values. For a more detailed discussion about sources of errors and their propagation to the estimated affinities, see Materials and Methods and fig. S8."
36542723_033,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"On the basis of nHU titration experiments, we obtained binding models other than hyperbolic in several occasions. Positive or negative cooperative mechanism assumes that a single bait molecule can interact with multiple prey molecules, where the binding affinities of subsequent binding events are increased or decreased, respectively. Since nHU experiments are carried out at large bait excess, it is rather unusual to observe such mechanisms, yet the presence of negative or positive cooperativity may indicate multivalent interactions (like in the case of SCRIB) or oligomeric prey molecules (like Vimentin), respectively. In addition to cooperative binding, partial activity was also observed. When single-point nHU experiments are carried out and we are lacking any a priori information about such mechanisms, Ockhamâs razor tells us to assume the simplest binding model for affinity conversion. However, this way, we introduce error in the conversion, affecting the resulting affinities in various directions. If a partial activity is ignored, we will always underestimate the real affinities. In contrast, if cooperative mechanisms are ignored, we can both over- and underestimate the real affinities depending on both the type of mechanism (negative or positive cooperativity) and the relative ratio of the bait concentration and the prey affinity."
36542723_034,PMC9770967,RESULTS,paragraph,"The dynamic range of the nHU assay is also related to the errors of concentration measurements, as well as to the bait concentration. Experimental determination of BI values is most accurate when the prey depletion is large enough to be robustly measured but small enough that the amount of the leftover prey is still measurable. In other words, if BI values are close to the extremes (close to 0 or 1), the affinity conversion is less reliable. Therefore, the dynamic range of BI measurements highly depends on the sensitivity and the robustness of the selected analytical method. Since the affinity conversion of these BI values only depends on the bait concentration (in case of a simple mechanism), the dynamic range of nHU in affinity units of measurement can only be estimated. As a guide, users of nHU need to pay attention to the quality of prey quantification and modify the bait concentration accordingly. By changing the bait concentration, for example, by changing the resin/analyte ratio or by mixing bait-saturated resin with control resin at various ratios, the BI values can be increased or decreased. Last, to measure very high affinities, one needs to decrease the amount of the bait and to dilute the analyte for maintaining the excess of the bait. Such condition reduces the accuracy of the protein concentration measurement and therefore the affinity estimation, and at a certain point, the nHU assay will only be capable of providing an estimation of the upper limit of affinities."

36542723_036,PMC9770967,DISCUSSION,paragraph,"Although common interactomic assays are efficient for interaction screening, most of them do not measure biophysical properties of interactions. Pull-downâbased approaches were used in several ways to gain quantitative insight into affinities of interactions. For example, measured âstoichiometricâ ratios of baits and preys have been used in immunoprecipitation experiments as a proxy to discriminate between âstrongâ and âweakâ complexes (39)â. Recently, we have also shown that in parallel pull-down experiments using various baits, the relative enrichment values of endogenous preys correlate with their corresponding fragmentomic affinities (12)â. Pull-down methods were even used to directly estimate affinities of baits using measured enrichment values, yet the consequences of washing steps were not considered (40, 41)â. Other types of methods have also been developed to measure affinities directly from cell extracts, but these are mostly low throughput and require high expertise (42 â 46)â. Therefore, we still lack a robust method to measure affinities from cell extracts, and most HTP affinity measurements are limited to labor-intensive fragmentomic approaches that require expensive reagents and instruments."
36542723_037,PMC9770967,DISCUSSION,paragraph,"Here, we introduced nHU as a versatile tool to measure apparent equilibrium affinities proteome-wide of recombinant or synthetic baits. Although these affinities can be indirect and can be perturbed by protein heterogeneity, nHU experiments can give us insight into an interactomic dimension that was never reached at this scale before: affinities of full-length proteins and even large complexes directly obtained from cell extracts. The resulting affinities are coherent between experiments and even between cell extracts and may provide better reproducibility for large-scale interactomic studies in the future. Compared to qualitative pull-downâbased methods, nHU involves less experimental steps and robustly ranks identified targets by their observed affinities. It can be equally used to cost-efficiently screen affinities across the proteome by using single-point measurements and to accurately investigate binding mechanisms using titration experiments. All mature protein analytical technologies can be used in combination with nHU, such as antibody-based approaches like routine WB or label-free MS. In principle, nHU is not limited to studying the interactions of proteins, and both baits and preys can be molecules of different kinds. Overall, nHU experiments can be effortlessly implemented in most laboratories and could greatly advance the exploration of the quantitative human affinity interactome."

36542723_039,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,Biotinylated peptides were chemically synthesized on an ABI 443A synthesizer with a standard Fmoc strategy with the biotin group attached to the N-terminus via a trioxatridecan-succinamic acid (ttds)linker and were purified with high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) (>95% purity). All C-terminal PBM peptides were 10 amino acid long (10-mer). Predicted peptide masses were confirmed by MS. Peptide concentrations were determined on the basis of their dry weight.

Lysates were frozen at â20Â°C before further purification steps. Lysates were sonicated and centrifuged for clarification. Expressed proteins were captured on in-house prepacked Ni-IDA (Protino Ni-IDA Resin, Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) columns and were washed with at least 10 column volumes of cold wash buffer [50 mM tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM Î²-mercaptoethanol] before elution with 250 mM imidazole.

Then, half of the supernatant was removed by pipetting without any delay to avoid any resin contamination; e.g., 100 Î¼l of supernatant is collected if 200 Î¼l of cell lysate was used as analyte. Alternatively, the supernatant can be centrifuged an additional time to clarify it further, removing any possible resin contamination. In principle, the separation of the supernatant should be as fast as possible since any delay can perturb the equilibrium. In practice, we did not observe changes in measured BI values if we recovered the supernatant within the first minute after centrifugation, possibly because the perturbation of equilibrium is, in part, a diffusion-limited process. Alternatively, the resin can be separated from the supernatant using filter plates (e.g., various products of Millipore, Burlington, MA) or spin columns (e.g., Pierce spin cupsâcellulose acetate filter from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) to achieve faster separation."

In the case of nHU-WB experiments, WBs were repeated three times to minimize the error of densitometric quantification, and mean values of determined BI values were used for affinity calculations. Since the same cell extract of known concentration was used for nHU-WB experiments, all samples were handled identically, and equal volumes of extracts were loaded on the acrylamide gels; GAPDH was only used to verify WB loading qualitatively in nHU-WB experiments.

In the case of the nHU-WB experiment between full-length SNX27 and SLC16A1, a BI offset was observed with the hyperbolic fit, and a partial activity was assumed using the function BI = f C bait (K app + C bait) (4)"

Fitting was performed in QtiPlot using standard procedures (scaled Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with 1000 iterations) and figures were generated with custom Python scripts using Matplotlib."
36542723_057,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"Affinities for each detected protein were calculated in nHU-MS experiments where the experimental BI was a positive value using Eq. 2; however, only those were considered for subsequent analysis where statistical robustness was observed. For each detected protein in nHU-MS experiments, a P value was calculated on the basis of the measured intensities of samples (nÂ =Â 6) and controls (nÂ =Â 6) using a two-tailed unpaired Studentâs t test. For each nHU-MS and AP-MS experiment series, a hyperbolic binding threshold was calculated taking into account both measured intensities and the general distribution of the entire dataset, similarly as described in other works (4)â. This threshold was calculated for AP-MS as follows y = y 0 + c (x â x 0) (6) and for nHU-MS experiments as y = y 0 + â c (x + x 0) (7) where y is the P value threshold at fold change of x,c is a curvature parameter empirically fixed at 1 for nHU-MS and 4 for AP-MS experiments, y 0 is the minimal P value threshold, and x 0 is the minimal fold change value for any given dataset. The minimal P value was defined at 1.3 âlog10(P), and thus, there is at least 95% probability that any identified interaction partners are true interaction partners. The minimal fold change value cutoff was set at 1 Ï and was determined by measuring the width of the normal distribution of all measured fold changes in a given experiment. Note that this threshold can only be interpreted for interaction partners with fold change values of âxÂ >Â x 0 in the case of nHU-MS experiments or xÂ >Â x 0 in the case of AP-MS experiments."
36542723_058,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"For simplicity, no multiple testing correction was applied. However, other statistical thresholding can also be used to minimize false discoveries. For example, multiple testing procedures, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg method, can be used to define an adjusted significance threshold value corresponding to 1 or 5% false discovery rate. Then, either this threshold can be considered as a standalone P value threshold, or it can replace the y 0 P value offset parameter in the hyperbolic binding threshold (Eq. 7). This way, type I error can be greatly minimized, yet type II error can increase."
36542723_059,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"Future users of nHU need to decide in accordance with their project to use or not to use such more stringent thresholds. They need to keep in mind that although they will obtain a more reliable list of binders with less false positives, at the same time, they may inevitably filter many interactions where the assay accurately quantified affinities. Measuring affinities of weak and transient interactions using modest bait concentration will result in low BI values, which, combined with the low precision of protein quantification, can yield low P values. However, neither a low P value nor a high one is indicative of the accuracy of the affinity measurement."
36542723_060,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"Although SDs of measured BI values can be calculated from replicates, it is challenging to propagate these errors to affinities. To do this in an analytical way, one has to first consider how the uncertainty of either or both total and free prey concentrations affect the uncertainty of BI values Ï BI â (â BI â C free â Ï C free) 2 + (â BI â C total â Ï C total) 2 (8) which can be simplified if concentrations are normalized (C total, normalizedÂ =Â 1) Ï BI â Ï C free, normalized + C free, normalized â Ï C total, normalized (9)"
36542723_061,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"Note that the uncertainty of the total amount of prey concentration mostly affects the overall uncertainty when the free concentration is close to the total (i.e., when the BI value is small). Error in the measurement of the BI values and errors of the estimated bait concentrations also propagate to the error of affinities Ï K app â (â K app â C bait â Ï C bait) 2 + (â K app â BI â Ï BI) 2 = ((1 â BI) â Ï C bait BI) 2 + (â C bait â Ï BI BI 2) 2 (10) where the assumed binding model was taken from Eq. 2. In principle, for each binding mechanism, the partial derivatives need to be determined. Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no direct way to measure neither the bait concentration nor its SD. On the basis of previous investigations, we have found that by following our protocols, the bait concentration can change over a twofold range in either direction. Bait concentration may also depend on the size of the immobilized protein in cases where a bound bait molecule could block or limit the binding of additional biotinylated bait molecules to neighboring streptavidin-binding sites by causing steric hindrance; however, this effect may only become substantial if the size of the bait reaches a critical value. Note that in case one compares affinities from a single experiment, the value of the bait concentration is constant through the experiment (with ÏC baitÂ =Â 0), and therefore, incorrect estimation of this value only causes a shift in estimated affinities. As a result, even in the absence of accurate bait concentrations, the ranking of measured BI values of partners identified from a single nHU experiment will match their affinity ranking. To visualize this error propagation, we used simulated data with random error in one of these parameters, or in a combination of parameters on fig. S8. Last, in the case of nHU titration experiments, fitting error may also greatly contribute to the error of the estimated affinity, depending on inaccurate models and experimental noise of protein quantification."
36542723_062,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"While BI measurements define the overall precision of any holdup assay, the affinity accuracy mainly depends on the bait concentration. At the moment, this parameter is only estimated on the basis of previous observations (12)â. In future generations of the nHU, more direct methods are needed to measure the error of this estimation that can be used to calculate affinities at high accuracy. For these reasons, we do not specify propagated errors for the calculated affinities since they would be misleading because absolute affinities could change with a more accurate bait concentration. However, affinity ranking of different prey measured from the same nHU experiment will be unaffected by such transformation. For example, on the basis of our experiments, we can conclude that the true affinity of SNX27 with Vimentin is stronger than with SLC16A1, and the affinity with SLC16A1 is stronger than with SLC1A5, but it is possible that these affinities can diverge systematically compared to the reported affinities."
36542723_063,PMC9770967,METHOD,paragraph,"Determined affinities can be combined with total protein concentrations to estimate amounts of binary complexes. These coarse predictions can be performed for any cellular proteomes, even at subcellular resolutions. We performed such calculations to estimate amounts of SNX-retromer-WASH complexes bound to SNX27 using estimated protein concentrations previously measured for HEK293T cells (35)â. In principle, such absolute proteomic datasets could also be estimated from the control nHU experiments directly using straightforward tools such as the proteomic ruler; however, one has to assume that the prepared cellular extract is representative of the entire cellular proteome of the monitored cell. In these calculations, one cannot use the hyperbolic binding equations (Eq. 2 or Eq. 3) since the concentrations of binding partners are comparable, and the partial binding occupation of SNX27 cannot be neglected. Instead, we used the quadratic binding equation (or similar) to make predictions [A B] = ([A] tot + [B] tot + K d) â ([A] tot + [B] tot + K d) 2 â 4 â ([A] tot â [B] tot) 2 (11) where [AB] is the concentration of the complex under equilibrium, [A]tot and [B]tot are the total concentrations of the binding partners (e.g., quantified with absolute proteomics), and K d is the steady-state dissociation constant. Calculated amounts of complexes were also converted into percentage of SNX27 bound by comparing the amounts of complexes with the total SNX27 concentration (280 nM). Note that although such calculations can be performed for PDZ-mediated interactions, results will be flawed because of their mutually exclusive nature. Future rule-based network-level calculations should consider affinities and concentrations of all PDZ and PBM proteins, as well as their binding mechanisms, to estimate amounts of all possible complexes in the network."

29309035_006,PMC5821459,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
29309035_007,PMC5821459,INTRO,paragraph,"Sequences resulting from retrotransposition constitute more than half of the human genome and are considered to be major change agents in eukaryotic genome evolution (Kazazian, 2004). L1 retrotransposons have been particularly active in mammals (Furano et al., 2004), comprisingÂ ~20% of the human genome (Lander et al., 2001); somatic retrotransposition has been widely implicated in cancer progression (Lee et al., 2012; Tubio et al., 2014) and may even play a role in neural development (Muotri et al., 2005). Despite the magnitude of their contributions to mammalian genomes, L1 genes are modest in size. A full-length L1 transcript isÂ ~6 knt long and functions as a bicistronic mRNA that encodes two polypeptides, ORF1p and ORF2p (Ostertag and Kazazian, 2001), which respectively comprise a homotrimeric RNA binding protein with nucleic acid chaperone activity (Martin and Bushman, 2001) and a multifunctional protein with endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities (Mathias et al., 1991; Feng et al., 1996). Recently, a putativeÂ primate-specific third ORF, named ORF0, has been identified on the Crick strand of the L1 gene; this ORF encodes a 71 amino acid peptide and may generate insertion-site-dependent ORFs via splicing (Denli et al., 2015). ORF1p and ORF2p are thought to interact preferentially with the L1 RNA from which they were translated (in cis), forming a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) (Kulpa and Moran, 2006; Taylor et al., 2013) considered to be the canonical direct intermediate of retrotransposition (Hohjoh and Singer, 1996; Kulpa and Moran, 2005; Martin, 1991; Kulpa and Moran, 2006; Doucet et al., 2010). L1 RNPs also require host factors to complete their lifecycle (Suzuki et al., 2009; Peddigari et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013) and, consistent with a fundamentally parasitic relationship (Beauregard et al., 2008), the host has responded by evolving mechanisms that suppress retrotransposition (Goodier et al., 2013; Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012; Goodier et al., 2012; Niewiadomska et al., 2007). It follows that as the host and the parasite compete, L1 expression is likely to produce a multiplicity of RNP forms engaged in discrete stages of retrotransposition, suppression, or degradation."
29309035_008,PMC5821459,INTRO,paragraph,"Although L1 DNA sequences are modestly sized compared to typical human genes, L1 intermediates are nevertheless RNPs with a substantially sized RNA component; e.g. larger than theÂ ~5 knt 28S rRNA (Gonzalez et al., 1985) and approximately three to four times the size of a âtypicalâ mRNA transcript (Lander et al., 2001; Sommer and Cohen, 1980). Therefore, it is likely that many proteins within L1 RNPs form interactions influenced directly and indirectly by physical contacts with the L1 RNA. We previously reported that L1 RNA comprised an estimatedÂ ~25% of mapped RNA sequencing reads in ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured fractions (Taylor et al., 2013). We also observed that the retention of ORF1p and UPF1 within affinity captured L1 RNPs was reduced by treatment with RNases (Taylor et al., 2013). In the same study we observed that two populations of ORF2p-associated proteins could be separated by split-tandem affinity capture (ORF2p followed by ORF1p), a two-dimensional affinity enrichment procedure (Caspary et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 2013). Initial characterization of these two L1 populations by western blotting suggested that discrete L1 populations were likely primed for function in different stages of the lifecycle. We therefore expected additional uncharacterized complexity in the spectrum of L1-associated complexes present in our affinity enriched fractions."
29309035_009,PMC5821459,INTRO,paragraph,"In this study, we have used quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to investigate the proteomic characteristics of endogenously assembled ectopic L1-derived macromolecules present in an assortment of affinity-enriched fractions. We revisited RNase treatment and split-tandem affinity capture approaches and complemented them with RNA sequencing, enzymatic analysis, and in-cell localization of ORF proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy (see also the companion manuscript by Mita et al., 2018). We additionally explored proteomes associated with catalytically-inactivated ORF2p point mutants and monitored the rates of protein exchange from L1 macromolecules in vitro. Taken together, our data support the existence of a variety of putative L1-related protein complexes."

29309035_011,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Affinity proteomic experiments conducted in this study use quantitative MS based upon metabolic labeling (Oda et al., 1999). Two main experimental designs (and modifications thereof) facilitating quantitative cross-sample comparisons have been used: SILAC (Ong et al., 2002; Wang and Huang, 2008) and I-DIRT (Tackett et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2013). In these approaches, cells are grown for several doublings in media containing amino acids composed either of naturally-occurring âlight' isotopes or biologically identical 'heavy' isotopes (e.g. 13C, 15N lysine and arginine), such that the proteomes are thoroughly labeled. Protein fractions derived from the differently labeled cell populations, obtained e.g. before and after experimental manipulations are applied, are mixed and the relative differences in proteins contributed by each fraction are precisely measured by mass spectrometry. In addition to the above cited studies, these approaches have been adapted to numerous biological questions using a variety of analytical frameworks e.g. (Byrum et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2016; Trinkle-Mulcahy et al., 2008; Ohta et al., 2010; Kaake et al., 2010; Geiger et al., 2011). Because it is challenging to speculate on the potential physiological roles of protein interactions that form after extraction from the cell, we often use I-DIRT, which allows the discrimination of protein-protein interactions formed in-cell from those occurring post-extraction. Our prior affinity proteomic study, based on I-DIRT, identified 37 putative in vivo interactors (Taylor et al., 2013), described in Table 1. In this study we primarily analyze the behaviors of these âI-DIRT significantâ L1 interactors, in order to determine their molecular associations and ascertain the variety of distinctive macromolecular complexes formed in-cell that copurify with affinity-tagged ORF2p. The complete lists of proteins detected in each experiment are presented in the supplementary information (see Supplementary file 1). We have represented any ambiguous protein group, which occurs when the same peptides identify a group of homologous protein sequences, with a single, consistently applied gene symbol and a superscript 'a' in all figures. Supplementary file 1 contains the references to other proteins explaining the presence of the same peptides. For example, RPS27A, (ubiquitin) UBB, UBC, and (ribosomal Protein L40) UBA52 can be explained by common ubiquitin peptides shared by these genes. RPS27A-specific peptides were not identified in this study, but we retained the nomenclature for consistency with our previous work; HSPA1A is reported in this study, but cannot be distinguished from the essentially identical protein product of HSPA1B."
29309035_012,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Except where noted otherwise, the presented experiments were conducted in suspension-cultured HEK-293TLD cells, using a synthetic L1 construct - ORFeus-HS - driving the expression 3xFLAG-tagged L1 (ORF1; ORF2::3xFLAG; 3â-UTR) from a tetracycline inducible minimal-CMV promoter, harbored on a mammalian episome (pLD401 (Taylor et al., 2013; An et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2012)). All L1-related macromolecules described in this study were obtained by affinity capture of ORF2p-3xFLAG before further experimental manipulations were applied. We consider macromolecules containing L1 RNA (L1 RNPs, discussed throughout) and/or an L1 cDNA (i.e. L1 coding potential) to be L1s, as are their ectopic plasmid-borne and endogenous gDNA counterparts, reflecting the complexity and diversity of L1 forms arising from its lifecycle. In an effort to characterize this complexity, we have carried out RNA sequencing and enzymatic activity analyses on several affinity captured fractions, complementing the proteomic analyses."
29309035_013,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Figure 1 (panels A-C) illustrates the approach and displays the findings of our assay designed to reveal which proteins depend upon the presence of intact L1 RNA for retention within the obtained L1 RNPs. Briefly, metabolically-labeled affinity captured L1s were treated either with a mixture of RNases A and T1 â thus releasing proteins that require intact RNA to remain linked to ORF2p and the affinity medium â or BSA, as an inert control. After removing the fractions released by the RNase or BSA treatments, the proteins remaining on the affinity media were eluted with lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS), mixed together, and then analyzed by MS. Proteins released, and so depleted, by RNase treatment were thus found to be more abundant in the BSA-treated control. The results obtained corroborate and extend our previous findings: ORF1p and UPF1 exhibited RNase-sensitivity (Taylor et al., 2013). We also observed that ZCCHC3 and MOV10 exhibited RNase-sensitivity to a level similar to ORF1p. The remaining I-DIRT significant proteins were RNase-resistant in this assay. With the exception of the PABPC1/4 proteins (and ORF2p itself, see Discussion), the I-DIRT significant proteins (colored nodes, Figure 1C) that were resistant to RNase treatment (nearest the origin of the graph) classify ontologically as nuclear proteins (GO:0005634, p â 3 Ã 10â4, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). These same proteins were previously observed as specific L1 interactors in I-DIRT experiments targeting ORF2p but not in those targeting ORF1p; in contrast, the proteins that demonstrated RNase-sensitivity: ORF1, MOV10, ZCCHC3, and UPF1 were observed in both ORF1p and ORF2p I-DIRT experiments (Table 1). Stated another way, the proteins released upon treating an affinity captured ORF2p fraction with RNases are among those that can also be obtained when affinity capturing ORF1p directly, while those that are RNase-resistant are not ORF1p interactors (Taylor et al., 2013). The ORF1p-linked, I-DIRT significant, RNase-sensitive proteins were too few to obtain a high confidence assessment of ontological enrichment; but, when combined with theÂ remaining proteins exhibiting sensitivity to RNase treatment (black nodes, Figure 1C), they together classified as 'RNA binding' (GO:0003723, p â 1 Ã 10â11). This analysis also revealed a statistically significant overrepresentation of genes associated with the exon junction complex (EJC, GO: 0035145, p â 1 Ã 10â6, discussed below). Hence, the overlapping portion of the ORF1p- and ORF2p-associated interactomes appeared to depend upon intact L1 RNA. Host-encoded proteins segregated into groups that responded differentially to RNase treatment, with a substantial population of RNase-resistant interactors linked to both ORF2p and the nucleus. This observation led to the hypothesis that our ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured L1s constitute a composite purification of at least, but not limited to, (1) a population of L1-RNA-dependent, ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNPs, and (2) an ORF1p-independent nuclear population associated with ORF2p."
29309035_014,PMC5821459,RESULT,fig_caption,"Figure 1.: RNase sensitivity and split-tandem affinity capture of L1 ORF2p RNPs. (A) On-bead RNase-sensitivity assay: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. The magnetic media were then treated with a solution containing either a mixture of RNases A and T1 or BSA. After treatment, the supernatants were removed and the remaining bound material was released with LDS. Proteins requiring intact RNA to maintain stable interactions with immobilized ORF2p were released from the RNase-treated medium, while the BSA-treated sample controlled for the spontaneous release of proteins from the medium. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained gel lanes are shown for each fraction. (B) The experiments described above wereÂ carried out in duplicate, once with light isotopically labeled cells (L) and once with heavy isotopically labeled cells (H), resulting in four label-swapped, SILAC duplicates (one light set and one heavy set). The four fractions were cross-mixed and the differential protein retention upon the affinity medium during the treatments (BSA vs. RNase) was assessed by quantitative MS. (C) Results from the RNase-sensitivity assay graphed as the fraction of each detected protein present in the BSA-treated sample (RNase-sensitive proteins are more present in the BSA treated sample), normalized such that proteins that did not change upon treatment with RNases are centered at the origin. A cut-off of p=10â3 for RNase-sensitivity is indicated by a light gray circle; proteins that are RNase-sensitive with a statistical significance of p<10â3 are outside the circle. Proteins previously ranked significant by I-DIRT analysis (Table 1) are labeled and displayed in blue or magenta (as indicated); black nodes were RNase-sensitiveÂ butÂ not significant by I-DIRT; gray, unlabeled nodes were neither RNase-sensitiveÂ norÂ significant by I-DIRT. (D) Split-tandem affinity capture: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. After native elution with 3xFLAG peptide, this fraction was depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes using an Î±-ORF1 conjugated magnetic medium, resulting in a supernatant fraction depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes. The Î±-ORF1 bound material was then released with LDS, yielding an elution fraction enriched for ORF1p-containing complexes. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained results for each fraction are shown. (E) SILAC duplicates, two supernatants and two elutions, were cross-mixed to enable an assessment of the relative protein content of each fraction by quantitative MS. (F) The results from split-tandem affinity capture graphed as the fraction of each protein observed in the elution sample. In order to easily visualize the relative degree of co-partitioning of constituent proteins with ORF1p, these data were normalized, setting the fraction of ORF1p in the elution to 1. Proteins which were previously ranked significant by I-DIRT analysis are labeled and displayed in blue or magenta (as indicated); gray, unlabeled nodes were not found to be significant by I-DIRT. MOV10 is marked with a dagger because in one replicate of this experiment it was detected by a single unique peptide, whereas we have enforced a minimum of two peptides (see Materials and methods) for all other proteins, throughout all other proteomic analyses presented here."
29309035_015,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"While effects of PABPC1, MOV10, and UPF1 on L1 activity have been described (Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2013; Dai et al., 2012), effects of ZCCHC3 on L1 remained uncharacterized. ZCCHC3 is an RNA-binding protein associated with poly(A)+Â RNAs (Castello et al., 2012) but otherwise little is known concerning its functions. Notably, in a genome-wide screen, small interfering (si)RNA knockdown of ZCCHC3 was observed to increase the infectivity of the Hepatitis C, a positive sense RNA virus (Li et al., 2009); and ZCCHC3 was observed to copurify with affinity captured HIV, a retrovirus, at a very high SILAC ratio (>10), supporting the specificity of this interaction (Engeland et al., 2014). We therefore explored the effects on L1 mobility both of over-expression and siRNA knockdown of ZCCHC3. Over-expression of ZCCHC3 reduced L1 retrotransposition toÂ ~10% that observed in the control, consistent with a negative regulatory role for ZCCHC3 in the L1 lifecycle; small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ZCCHC3 induced a modest increase in retrotransposition compared to a scrambled control siRNA (~1.9x Â± 0.1; Supplementary file 2). Moreover, although not among our I-DIRT hits (see Discussion), the presence of EJC components (MAGOH, RBM8A, EIF4A3, UPF1) among the RNase-sensitive fraction of proteins intrigued us, given that L1 genes are intronless. We speculated that L1s may use EJCs to enhance nuclear export, evade degradation by host defenses, and/or aggregate with mRNPs within cytoplasmic granules. For this reason we carried out a series of siRNA knockdowns of these EJC components and other physically or functionally related proteins found in the affinity captured fraction (listed in Supplementary file 2). siRNA knockdowns of RBM8A and EIF4A3 caused inviability of the cell line. We found that knocking-down MAGOH or the EJC-linked protein IGF2BP1 (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007) reduced retrotransposition byÂ ~50%, consistent with a role in L1 proliferation; although these knockdowns also caused a reduction in viability of the cell line (see Discussion)."
29309035_016,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"To further test our hypothesis and better characterize the components of our L1 fraction, we conducted split-tandem affinity capture. Figure 1 (panels D-F) illustrates the approach and displays the findings of the assay, which physically separated ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNPs from a presumptive 'only-ORF2p-associated' population. Briefly, metabolically-labeled L1s were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG (first dimension) and the obtained composite was subsequently further fractionated by Î±-ORF1p affinity capture (second dimension, or split-tandem capture), resulting in Î±-ORF1p-bound and unbound (supernatant)Â fractions. The bound fraction was eluted from the affinity medium with LDSÂ (elution). The supernatant and elution fractions were then mixed and analyzed by MS to ascertain proteomic differences between them. The Î±-ORF1p elutionÂ contained the population of proteins physically linked to both ORF2p and ORF1p, whereas the supernatant contained the proteins associated only with ORF2p (and, formally, those which have dissociated from the ORF1p/ORF2p RNP). The results corroborated our previous observations that: (i) almost all of the ORF1p partitioned into the elution fractions, (ii) a quarter of the ORF2p (~26%) followed ORF1p during the Î±-ORF1p affinity capture, (iii) roughly half of the UPF1 (~55%) followed ORF1p, and (iv) most of the PCNA (~87%) remained in the ORF1p-depleted supernatant fraction (Figure 1F, and consistent with prior estimates based on protein staining and western blotting [Taylor et al., 2013]); thus (v) supporting the existence of at least two distinct populations of L1-ORF-protein-containing complexes in our affinity purifications."
29309035_017,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"The population eluted from the Î±-ORF1p affinity medium (Figure 1D, far right gel lane, and nodes located in the upper right of the graph, panel F) is consistent with the composition of the ORF1p/ORF2p-containing L1 RNP suggested above. Our split-tandem separation segregated the constituents of the L1 fraction comparably to the RNase-sensitivity assay, both in terms of which proteins co-segregated with ORF1p/ORF2p (compare Figure 1C and F, blue nodes, upper right of graphs) as well as those which appear to be linked only to ORF2p (compare Figure 1C and F, magenta nodes, lower left of the graphs). The ORF1p/ORF2p RNPs obtained by split-tandem capture included putative in vivo interactions associated with both Î±-ORF1p and Î±-ORF2p I-DIRT affinity capture experiments; whereas the unbound, ORF1p-independent fraction includes proteins previously observed as significant only in Î±-ORF2p I-DIRT experiments (Table 1). Analysis of the nodes whose degree of ORF1p association was similar to that of UPF1 (blue nodes exhibitingÂ â¥55% ORF1p co-partitioning, Figure 1F) revealed that they map ontologically to a âcytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granuleâ classification (GO:0036464, p â 6 Ã 10â8; see Discussion). In contrast, all sixteen proteins exhibiting ORF1p co-partitioning approximately equal to or less than that of ORF2p were predominantly found in the supernatant fraction and were enriched for cell-compartment-specific association with the nucleus (GO:0005634, p â 4 Ã 10â5; Figure 1F: all magenta nodesÂ â¤36%). These two fractions therefore appear to be associated with different cell compartments, reaffirming our postulate: the ORF1p/ORF2p-containing population is a cytoplasmic intermediate related to the canonical L1 RNP typically ascribed to L1 assembly in the literature, and the predominantly ORF2p-associated population comprises a putative nuclear interactome."
29309035_018,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"From the same analysis, we noted that PURA, PURB, PCNA, and TOP1 which all partition predominantly with nuclear L1, exhibited an ontological co-enrichment (termed 'nuclear replication fork,' GO:0043596, p â 3 Ã 10â4). The nodes representative of PURA, PURB, and PCNA appeared to exhibit a striking proximity to one another, suggesting highly similar co-fractionation behavior potentially indicative of direct physical interactions. In an effort to examine this possibility, we graphed the frequency distribution of the proximities of all three-node-clusters observed within Figure 1F, revealing the likelihood of the PURA/PURB/PCNA cluster to be p=3.2Ã10â7 (see Appendix 1). We therefore concluded that PURA, PURB, PCNA, and (perhaps at a lower affinity) TOP1, likely constitute a physically associated functional module interacting with L1. In further support of this assertion, we noted that known functionally linked protein pairs PABPC1/PABPC4 (cytoplasmic) (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007; Katzenellenbogen et al., 2007) and HSPA8/HSPA1A (nuclear) (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007; Nellist et al., 2005) also exhibited comparable co-partitioning by visual inspection, and statistical testing of these clusters revealed the similarity of their co-partitioning to be significant at p â 0.001 for the former, and p â 0.0002 for the latter. The observed variation in co-partitioning behavior between the different proteins comprising the nuclear L1 fraction might reflect the presence of multiple distinctive (sub)complexes present within this population."
29309035_019,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"To validate our hypothesis that these proteins are associated with ORF2p in the nucleus, possibly engaged with host genomic DNA, we carried out ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity capture from chromatin-enriched sub-cellular fractions and found that the co-captured proteins we identified (Supplementary file 3) overlapped with those described above as nuclear interactors, including: PARP1, PCNA, UPF1, PURA, and TOP1. We previously demonstrated that silencing PCNA expression adversely affects L1 retrotransposition (Taylor et al., 2013), in this study we found that knocking down TOP1 approximately doubled retrotransposition frequency, while a more modest 1.4x increase effect was observed for PURA, and no substantial effect was observed for PURB, compared to a scrambled siRNA control. In contrast, over-expression of PURA reduced retrotransposition toÂ ~20% of the expected level (Supplementary file 2). IPO7 was also observed among the putative ORF2p co-factors within the chromatin enriched fraction, congruent with its matching behavior in Figure 1C and F. Notably, IPO7 functions as a nuclear import adapter for HIV reverse transcription complexes (Fassati et al., 2003). Several other proteins thatÂ were observed did not previously exhibit I-DIRT specificity (Supplementary file 3)."
29309035_020,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Because the L1 RNA is an integral component of proliferating L1s, and because we observed that interactions between ORF2p, ORF1p, and some host proteins were sensitive to treatment with RNases, we sought to characterize the RNAs present in our samples. We extracted RNAs from each of the three fractions produced by split-tandem affinity capture (Figure 1D) and carried out RNA sequencing; Figure 2A displays the sequence coverage observed across the entirety of our synthetic L1 construct in each fraction, revealing a normalizedÂ ~2 fold difference in abundance between the elution and supernatant fractions. Synthetic L1s constitutedÂ ~60% of the mapped, annotated sequence reads in the fractions eluted from the Î±-FLAG and Î±-ORF1p affinity media, andÂ ~30% of the reads in the ORF1p-depleted supernatant fraction; sequencing reads mapping to protein coding genes made up the majority of the remaining annotated population in all fractions. We observed that a substantial number of reads mapped to unannotated regions of the human genome, in particular in the supernatant fraction, enriched for putative nuclear L1 complexes; the breakdown of mapped and annotated sequencing reads is summarized in Figure 2B and expanded in Supplementary file 4."

29309035_022,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Retrotransposition-competent L1 RNPs form in cis, with ORF proteins binding to the L1 RNA that encoded them (âcis preferenceâ), presumably at the site of translation in the cytoplasm (Kulpa and Moran, 2006; Wei et al., 2001). Given that ORF1/2p partitioned to the split-tandem elution fraction (cytoplasmic)Â along with the greater fraction of L1 RNA, yet only ORF2p and a lesser portion of the L1 RNA were observed in the supernatantÂ (nuclear), an important consideration regarding these fractions is: to what extent they contain L1 macromolecules capable of proliferation. To address this question, we performed the LINE-1 element amplification protocol (LEAP) on split-tandem affinity captured fractions (Figure 2C; Supplementary file 4), including a ÎORF1 construct (pLD561) as a control (Taylor et al., 2013). LEAP is currently the best biochemical assay for functional co-assembly of L1 RNA and proteins (Kulpa and Moran, 2006); it measures the ability of ORF2p to amplify its associated L1 RNA by reverse transcription. To execute LEAP on the Î±-ORF1p affinity captured fraction, we developed a competitive di-peptide elution reagent based on the linear peptide sequence used to generate the Î±-ORF1p 4H1 monoclonal antibody: residues 35â44 in ORF1p ([Khazina et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2013]; see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). We were thus able to assay the partitioning of enzymatic activity within the different populations of copurifying proteins in a split-tandem affinity capture experiment. Our data showed robust LEAP activity in both nuclear and cytoplasmic split-tandem supernatant and elution fractions. We note that our 3xFLAG eluted fractions have been shown to possessÂ ~70 fold higher specific activity than L1 RNPs obtained by sucrose cushion velocity sedimentation (Taylor et al., 2013), hence the activity levels detected far exceed those obtained by sedimentation."
29309035_023,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Although our proteomic and biochemical analyses supported the existence of distinctive nuclear and cytoplasmic L1 populations, our prior immunofluorescence (IF) analyses did not reveal an apparent nuclear population, leading us to revisit IF studies. Previously, IF of ORF1p and ORF2p in HeLa and HEK-293T cells yielded two striking observations: (i) ORF2 expression was seemingly stochastic, with ORF2p observed inÂ ~30% of cells; and (ii) while ORF1p and ORF2p co-localized in cells that exhibited both, we did not observe an apparent nuclear population of either protein (Taylor et al., 2013). Subsequently, we noted an absence of mitotic cells from these preparations. Reasoning that these cells were lost due to selective adherence on glass slides, and noting that cell division has been reported to promote L1 transposition (Xie et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2007), we repeated the assays using puromycin-selected Tet-on HeLa cells grown on fibronectin coated coverslips. The results are shown in Figure 3."

29309035_025,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"The modified IF assay corroborated our prior results in that nearly all the cells exhibited cytoplasmic ORF1p and a minority subset ofÂ ~1/3rd also exhibited co-localized cytoplasmic ORF2p (Figure 3A, top row). We also observed anÂ uncommon and previously unrecognized subpopulation of cells, consisting of pairs exhibiting nuclear localized ORF2p (Figure 3A, middle row); because these cells occurred in proximal pairs, we presumed them to have recently gone through mitosis. Statistical analysis of microscopy images displaying cells with nuclear localized ORF2p confirmed their proximities to be significantly closer than those of randomly selected cells (Figure 3B; Supplementary file 5). Expression of ORF2 in the absence of ORF1 (ÎORF1; pLD561) resulted in the majority of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic ORF2p, consistent with our previous work (Taylor et al., 2013). We did not observe instances of nuclear ORF2p using the ÎORF1 construct (Figure 3A, bottom row), suggesting that ORF1p is required for ORF2p nuclear localization (see Discussion). In a separate study, including more detailed analyses of ORF protein localization, Mita et al., 2018 observed that both ORF proteins enter the nucleus of HeLa cells during mitosis, however, nuclear ORF1p does not seem to be physically associated with nuclear ORF2p (see Discussion). Taken together, the data obtained from the modified IF experiments aligned well with our proteomic and biochemical data; L1 expression resulted in at least two distinct populations: cytoplasmic complexes containing both ORF1p and ORF2p, and nuclear complexes containing ORF2p while potentially lacking ORF1p."
29309035_026,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"Based on the hypothesis that our composite purifications contain bona fide nuclear intermediates, we decided to explore the effects of catalytic point mutations within the ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains, respectively. We reasoned that such mutants may bottleneck L1 intermediates at the catalytic steps associated with host gDNA cleavage and L1 cDNA synthesis, potentially revealing protein associations that are important for these discrete aspects of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT), the presumed mechanism of L1 transposition (Luan et al., 1993; Feng et al., 1996; Cost et al., 2002). For this we used an H230A mutation to inactivate the endonuclease activity (EN-/pLD567), and a D702Y mutation to inactivate the reverse transcriptase activity (RT-/pLD624) (Taylor et al., 2013). Figure 4 illustrates the approach and displays the findings of our assay. Broadly, while we observed comparable RNA-level properties between samples (Figure 4B, Supplementary file 4), our findings revealed several classes of distinctive protein-level behaviors (Figure 4C). Two classes of behavior appeared to be particularly striking: (1) the yield of constituents of cytoplasmic L1s was reduced, relative to WT, by the EN- mutation, yet elevated by the RT- mutation (Figure 4C, left side); and (2) numerous constituents of nuclear L1s were elevated in yield by the EN- mutation but reduced or nominally unchanged, relative to WT, by the RT- mutation (Figure 4C, right side). With respect to the second group, IPO7, NAP1L4, NAP1L1, FKBP4, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 were all elevated in the EN- mutants, potentially implicating these proteins as part of an L1 complex (or complexes) immediately preceding DNA cleavage. Notably, there is a third class of proteins, including PURA/B, PCNA, TOP1, and PARP1, that all respond similarly to both EN- and RT- mutants compared to WT, exhibiting reduced associations with the mutant L1s; although, the RT- mutant showed a larger effect size on the PURA/B proteins. These data suggest that cleavage of the host genomic DNA byÂ ORF2pÂ fosters associations between L1 and this third class of proteins, but that interactions with PURA/B may be further enhanced by L1 cDNA production. Other nuclear L1 proteins: HSPA8, HAX1, HSPA1A, TUBB, and TUBB4B were increased in both mutants. To better visualize the range of behaviors exhibited by our proteins of interest, and the population at large, we cross-referenced the relative enrichments of each protein detected in both experiments, shown in Figure 4D. We noted the same striking trend mentioned above, that two seemingly opposite behavioral classes of interactors could also be observed globally among all proteins associating with ORF2p catalytic mutants (see Figure 4C, left side and right side, and Figure 4D), creating the crisscross pattern displayed (see also Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Notably, the pattern observed appears to track with the relative behavior of ORF1p, which, along with other cytoplasmic L1 factors is elevated in RT- mutants and reduced in EN- mutants. We therefore speculate that the sum of observed interactomic changes include effects attributable directly to the catalytic mutations as well as potentialÂ indirect effects resulting in increased cytoplasmic RNPs (including ORF1p)inÂ theÂ RT-Â mutant."

29309035_028,PMC5821459,RESULT,paragraph,"We next decided to measure the in vitro dynamics of proteins copurifying with affinity captured L1s, reasoning that proteins with comparable profiles are likely candidates to be physically linked to one another or otherwise co-dependent for maintaining stable interactions with L1s. To achieve this, we first affinity captured heavy-labeled, affinity-tagged L1s and subsequently incubated them, while immobilized on the medium, with light-labeled, otherwise identically prepared cell extracts from cells expressing untagged L1s (Luo et al., 2016). In this scenario, heavy-labeled proteins present at the zero time point are effectively âinfinitely dilutedâ with light-labeled cell extract. The exchange of proteins, characterized by heavy-labeled proteins decaying from the immobilized L1s and being replaced by light-labeled proteins supplied by the cell extract, was monitored by quantitative MS. These experiments were conducted using constructs based on the naturally occurring L1RP sequence (Dai et al., 2014; Taylor et al., 2013; Kimberland et al., 1999). Figure 5 illustrates the approach and displays the findings of our assay. We observed three distinctive clusters of behaviors (Figure 5B,C). Notably, ORF1p, ZCCHC3, and the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins clustered together, forming a relatively stable core complex. Exhibiting an intermediate level of relative in vitro dynamics, UPF1 and MOV10 clustered with TUBB, TUBB4B, and HSP90AA1. A third, and least stable, cluster consisted of only nuclear L1 interactors."

29309035_033,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In this study we have characterized biochemical, interatomic, enzymatic, and cellular localization properties of ectopically expressed L1s. Through the assays explored, we observed discrete and coordinated behaviors, permitting us to refine our model of L1 intermediates, diagrammed in Figure 7. We propose a cytoplasmic L1, composed of ORF1/2 p, L1 RNA, PABPC1/4, MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3, that constitutes an abundant, canonical RNP intermediate often referred to in the literature. MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3 are apparently substoichiometric to ORF2p in our preparations, therefore it may be that only a subset of cytoplasmic intermediates engages these host restriction factors. On the other hand, this apparent relative abundance may simply reflect a lower in vitro stability of UPF1 and MOV10 within this complex (Figure 5). Although ORF1p is apparently required for efficient ORF2p nuclear entry, we also propose a second more complicated population, lacking (or with significantly less) ORF1p, that constitutes nuclear or pre- dominantly nuclear L1 macromolecules. We note that Alu elements exhibit ORF2p-dependent mobilization that does not require ORF1p, but appears to be enhanced by ORF1p in some contexts (Dewannieux et al., 2003; Wallace et al., 2008); this is not true for L1 or processed pseudogenes, and we conclude Alu RNPs likely exploit an alternate mechanism of nuclear entry. The nuclear L1 population is enriched for factors linked to DNA replication and repair, including PURA, PURB, PCNA, TOP1, and PARP1; we propose that these proteins, along with ORF2p, form part of a direct intermediate of TPRT, although these components may not all act in synergy. Our proposals are broadly supported by the findings of Mita et al., 2018, who present data to support the hypothesis that PCNA-associated ORF2p is not appreciably associated with ORF1p, and also identified TOP1 and PARP1 in complex with ORF2p/PCNA."
29309035_034,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,fig_caption,"Figure 7.: Refined interatomic model: Our results support the existence of distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear L1 interactomes. Affinity capture of L1 via 3xFLAG-tagged ORF2p from cell extracts results in a composite purification consisting of several macromolecular (sub)complexes. Among these, we propose a canonical cytoplasmic L1 RNP (depicted) and one or more nuclear macromolecules. UPF1 exhibited equivocal behavior within our fractionations and was also co-captured with chromatin associated ORF2p, suggesting it participates in both cytoplasmic and nuclear L1 interactomes. Within the nuclear L1 interactome, our data support the existence of a physically linked entity consisting of (at least) PCNA, PURA/B, TOP1, and PARP1 (depicted)."
29309035_035,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although the protein purification approach was the similar, we observed an apparently larger proportion of L1 RNA in our recent preparations than in our previous study. We reported that L1 constitutedÂ ~25% of mapped reads previously (Taylor et al., 2013); a comparable result was obtained when we reanalyzed that data using the pipeline described here (see Materials and methods): ~93% of reads in ourÂ reanalyzed 2013 dataset mapped to the human genome, and L1 constitutedÂ ~20% of reads mapped to annotated features (âannotated readsâ) in 3xFLAG eluates. In this study we report thatÂ ~60% of annotated reads mapped to synthetic L1 in 3xFLAG eluates (Figure 2A). The higher proportion of L1 recovered may be due to the combination of higher fidelity RNA preparative methods and advanced sequencing technology used here; we observedÂ ~10x more total reads mapping to L1 and comparatively improved, more uniform coverage across the entire L1 sequence, likely explaining the discrepancy. We also noted that the number of normalized reads mapped to L1 in our initial 3xFLAG elutions (âinputâ) and subsequent tandem-purified Î±-ORF1p elutions were comparable, and yetÂ ~1/2 as many were seen in the Î±-ORF1p supernatant fraction (Figure 2A,B). We suspect that this is due to saturation in library preparations or sequencing steps for the âinputâ and âelutionâ fractions, but conclude that more L1 RNA is in the âcytoplasmicâ elution fraction than the ânuclearâ supernatant."
29309035_036,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We observed substantial and comparable LEAP activity in both our tandem-purified ORF1p+ (âelutionâ) and ORF1pâ (immuno-depleted âsupernatantâ) populations (Figure 2C, Supplementary file 4). To our knowledge, these represent the simplest and purest endogenously assembled L1 RNPs yet reported that exhibit robust signal in the LEAP assay. We note that, our results demonstrating robust activity in the nuclear-enriched supernatant fraction (depleted of ORF1p) may contrast with previous reports of reduced LEAP activity in constructs where ORF1p RNA binding was compromised (Kulpa and Moran, 2006), but our fractions merit further study and comparisons on the basis of ORF2p and RNA levels to determine specific activity."
29309035_037,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"ORF1p, MOV10, UPF1, and ZCCHC3 are released from L1 RNPs by treatment with RNases (Figure 1), indicating the importance of the L1 RNA in the maintenance of these interactions. In this context, the L1 ORF and poly(A) binding proteins support L1 proliferation (Kulpa and Moran, 2006; Dai et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2001), whereas ZCCHC3 (Supplementary file 2) and MOV10 (Goodier et al., 2012; Arjan-Odedra et al., 2012) function in repressive capacities. Although UPF1 might also be expected to operate in a repressive capacity through its role in nonsense mediated decay (NMD), we previously demonstrated that UPF1's role does not apparently resemble that of canonical NMD and it acts as an enhancer of retrotransposition despite negatively affecting L1 RNA and protein levels, supporting the possibility of repressive activity in the cytoplasm and proliferative activity in the nucleus (Taylor et al., 2013). Notably, MOV10 has been implicated in the recruitment of UPF1 to mRNA targets through protein-protein interactions (Gregersen et al., 2014). However, we observed that MOV10 exhibited a greater degree of RNase-sensitivity than UPF1, indicating that, if MOV10 directly modulates the UPF1 interactions with L1, a sub-fraction of UPF1 exhibits a distinct behavior (UPF1 isÂ ~62% as sensitive to RNase treatment as MOV10, Figure 1C). Bimodal UPF1 behavior can also be seen in split-tandem capture experiments, only about half of the UPF1 exhibited ORF1p-like partitioning with the canonical L1 RNP (Figure 1F). Moreover, UPF1 was recovered with L1s affinity captured from fractionated chromatin (further discussed below), and only about half of the UPF1 exhibits ORF1p-like partitioning with the canonical L1 RNP (Figure 1F). Presumably, the RNase-sensitive fraction, released in concert with MOV10, is the same fraction observed in cytoplasmic L1s obtained by split-tandem capture. In contrast, PABPC1 and C4 exhibit strong ORF1p-like partitioning (comparable to MOV10), but appear wholly insensitive to RNase treatment. This is most likely due to the fact that neither RNase A nor T1 cleave RNA at adenosine residues (Volkin and Cohn, 1953; Yoshida, 2001); hence poly(A) binding proteins may not be ready targets for release from direct RNA binding by the assay implemented here (or generally, using these ribonucleases). Failure to release ORF2p into the supernatant upon RNase treatment is expected due to its immobilization upon the affinity medium (Dai et al., 2014). However, we note that ORF2p binding to the L1 RNA has also been proposed to occur at the poly(A) tail (Doucet et al., 2015), raising the related possibility of close physical association on the L1 RNA between ORF2p and PABPC1/4 in cytoplasmic L1 RNPs. ORF1p, PABPC1/4, MOV10, ZCCHC3, and UPF1, all behaved comparably in response to EN- and RT- catalytic mutations, decreasing together in EN- mutants, and increasing together in RT- mutants (Figure 4C). Moreover, when the exchange of proteins within L1 RNPs was monitored directly, PABPC1/4 and ZCCHC3 exhibited nearly identical stability, well above the background distribution; UPF1 and MOV10 also exhibited comparable kinetics to one another, falling into an intermediary stability cluster (Figure 5B,C)."
29309035_038,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"RNase-sensitivity was displayed by numerous proteins not previously identified as putative L1 interactors (Table 1, Figure 1; [Taylor et al., 2013]). A known limitation of I-DIRT (and many SILAC-based analyses) is that it cannot discriminate non-specific interactors from specific but rapidly exchanging interactors (Wang and Huang, 2008; Luo et al., 2016; Smart et al., 2009). Our samples likely contain rapidly exchanging, physiologically relevant factors that were not revealed by I-DIRT under the experimental conditions used. With this in mind, we note members of the exon junction complex (EJC), RBM8A (Y14), EIF4A3 (DDX48), and MAGOH, are among our RNase-sensitive constituents, all exhibiting a similar degree of RNase-sensitivity (Figure 1C, labeled black dots). Crucially, these proteins are physically and functionally connected to UPF1 (reviewed in [Schweingruber et al., 2013]), and physically to MOV10 (Gregersen et al., 2014), both validated L1 interactors. We therefore hypothesize that EJCs may constitute bona fide L1 interactors missed in our original screen. This may seem unexpected because canonical L1 RNAs are thought not to be spliced, but this assumption has been challenged by one group (Belancio et al., 2006), and splicing-independent recruitment of EJCs has also been demonstrated (Budiman et al., 2009). Perhaps more compelling, EJC proteins exhibited a striking similarity in RNase-sensitivity to MOV10 (Figure 1C). EIF4A3 has been suggested to form an RNA-independent interaction with MOV10 (Gregersen et al., 2014), and MOV10 is a known negative regulator of L1, making it attractive to speculate that these proteins were recruited and released in concert with MOV10 and/or UPF1."
29309035_039,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Ectopically expressed canonical L1 RNPs have been shown to accumulate in cytoplasmic stress granules (Doucet et al., 2010; Goodier et al., 2010), and our observation of UPF1, MOV10, and MAGOH in the RNase-sensitive fraction is consistent with this characterization (Jain et al., 2016). However, the additional presence of EIF4A3 and RBM8A suggested that our RNPs may instead overlap with IGF2BP1 (IMP1) granules, reported to be distinct from stress granules (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007; Weidensdorfer et al., 2009). Consistent with this possibility, we observed IGF2BP1, YBX1, DHX9, and HNRNPU within the mixture of co-captured proteins (Supplementary file 1). We did not, however, observe canonical stress granule markers G3BP1 or TIA1 (Goodier et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2016; Doucet et al., 2010). Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown of IGF2BP1 substantially reduced L1 retrotransposition; however, we note that the cytotoxicity associated with knocking-down EJC components may confound interpretation (Supplementary file 2). Given the result obtained, IGF2BP1 appears to support L1 proliferation. Consistent with an established function (Bley et al., 2015; Weidensdorfer et al., 2009), IGF2BP1 granules may sequester and stabilize L1 RNPs in the cytoplasm, creating a balance of L1 supply and demand that favors proliferation over degradation. Although human L1 does not contain a known IRES, it is known that ORF2 is translated by a non-canonical mechanism (Alisch et al., 2006), and IGF2BP1 may promote this (Weinlich et al., 2009)."
29309035_040,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The fraction eluted from the Î±-ORF1p medium contained the population of proteins physically linked to both ORF2p and ORF1p and greatly resembled the components released upon RNase treatment, hence these linkages primarily occur through the L1 RNA (or are greatly influenced by it). In contrast, the supernatant from the Î±-ORF1p affinity capture contained the proteins we speculate to be associated with ORF2p, but not ORF1p; moreover, fully intact RNA does not appear to be essential to the maintenance of these interactions. An exciting alternate interpretation to direct protein-protein linkage is that some of the L1 RNAs in this population may be at least partially hybridized to L1 cDNAs, which would render them RNase resistant: at the salt concentration used in our RNase assay (0.5 M; Figure 1C), RNase A is unlikely to cleave the RNA component of DNA/RNA hybrids (HalÃ¡sz et al., 2017; Wyers et al., 1973), and such activity is not expected of RNase T1. This interpretation is supported by several pieces of indirect evidence: (1) the presence of well-known DNA binding factors (Figure 1); (2) the presence of several of these same factors (PARP1, PCNA, PURA, and TOP1) in ORF2p-3xFLAG affinity captured from enriched chromatin (Supplementary file 3); (3) The pronounced decrease in stable in vivo co-assembly of TOP1, PCNA, PARP1, PURA, and PURB in affinity captured L1 fractions harboring ORF2p EN- and RT- mutations (Figure 4), with a greater effect in RT- mutations; and (4) our L1 preparations exhibit RT activity (Figure 2C, in vitro; as well as in vivo [Taylor et al., 2013]). If true, linkage of subcomplexes via DNA/RNA hybrids would further support the nuclear origin of much of this fraction; further study is needed. Notable within this group of putative nuclear interactors was the PURA/PURB/PCNA cluster (Figure 1F), with TOP1 also in close proximity, ontologically grouping to the nuclear replication fork (GO:0043596). Separately, a few physical and functional connections have been shown for PURA/PURB (Knapp et al., 2006; Kelm et al., 1999; Mittler et al., 2009), PCNA/TOP1 (Takasaki et al., 2001), and PURA/PCNA (Qin et al., 2013). Notably, PURA, PURB, and PCNA have been independently linked to replication-factor-C/replication factor-C-like clamp loaders (Kubota et al., 2013; Havugimana et al., 2012). Given that we also observe tight clustering of protein pairs known to be physically and functionally linked, e.g. PABPC1/4 (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007; Katzenellenbogen et al., 2007) and HSPA8/1A (JÃ¸nson et al., 2007; Nellist et al., 2005), and because we have established PCNA as a positive regulator of L1 retrotransposition (Taylor et al., 2013), we propose that the [PURA/B/PCNA/TOP1] group is a functional sub-complex of nuclear L1. In addition, although it does not cluster as closely to the [PURA/B/PCNA/TOP1] group, PARP1 is found within the putative nuclear L1 population and is functionally linked with PCNA, specifically stalled replication forks (Bryant et al., 2009; Min et al., 2013; Ying et al., 2016). Further tying them together, these proteins all also exhibited substantial affinity capture yield decreases in response to mutations that abrogated ORF2p EN or RT activity (Figure 4). This is compelling because these ORF2p enzymatic activities are required in order for it to manipulate DNA and traverse the steps of the L1 lifecycle that benefit from physical association with replication forks. One caveat to this interpretation is that, while knocking down PCNA reduced L1 retrotransposition (Taylor et al., 2013), no such effect was observed for TOP1 or PURA/B, which led instead to mild increases in L1 activity (Supplementary file 2). These proteins may be physically assembled within a common intermediate, but functionally antagonistic. HSP90 proteins were also observed in this fraction, and are also linked with stalled replication forks (Arlander et al., 2003; Ha et al., 2011), but exhibited a distinctive response to catalytic mutants, accumulating in EN- mutants while exhibiting a modest decrease in RT- mutants. The recruitment of the ORF2p/PCNA complex to stalled replication forks has been also proposed by Mita et al., 2018."
29309035_041,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"As mentioned above, we previously speculated that an RNase-insensitive fraction of L1-associated UPF1 may support retrotransposition in conjunction with PCNA in the nucleus (Azzalin and Lingner, 2006; Taylor et al., 2013 and Mita et al., 2018). In contrast to other PCNA-linked proteins, catalytic inactivation of ORF2p did not robustly affect the relative levels of co-captured UPF1, and UPF1 behaved in a distinct manner during tandem capture. The equivocal behavior of UPF1 in several assays (Figures 1, 4 and 5) supports UPF1âs association with both the putative cytoplasmic and nuclear L1 populations, the latter being additionally supported by the association of UPF1 with ORF2p-3xFLAG captured from chromatin (Supplementary file 3). NAP1L4, NAP1L1, FKBP4, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 (Baltz et al., 2012; Castello et al., 2012; Simon et al., 1994; Rodriguez et al., 1997; Peattie et al., 1992) are associated with RNA binding, involved in protein folding and unfolding, and function as nucleosome chaperones. An interesting possibility is that they have a nucleosome remodeling activity that may be required to allow reverse transcription to begin elongating efficiently, or for assembly of nucleosomes on newly synthesized DNA."
29309035_042,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"An obvious need is the continued validation of putative interactors by in vivo assays. Genetic knockdowns coupled with L1 insertion measurements by GFP fluorescence (Ostertag et al., 2000) provide a powerful method to detect effects on L1 exerted by host factors. However, this approach can sometimes be limited by cell viability problems associated with important genes; it is therefore critical to control for this (Supplementary file 2). IF and high-resolution microscopy may be useful to demonstrate co-localization of putative L1-associated proteins and may also be informative, warranting effort to identify appropriate antibodies and assay conditions. Bolstered by our analytical successes, RNA-sequencing, LEAP, and RNase-based affinity proteomics appear as notably high-value assays for further application-specific expansion and refinement."
29309035_043,PMC5821459,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Throughout this and our prior study (Taylor et al., 2013) we have used comparable in vitro conditions for the capture and analysis of L1 interactomes. However, we are aware that this practice has enforced a single biochemical âkeyholeâ through which we have viewed L1-host protein associations. It is important to expand the condition space in which we practice L1 interactome capture and analysis in order to expand our vantage point on the breadth of L1-related macromolecules (Hakhverdyan et al., 2015). In concert with this, we must develop sophisticated, automated, reliable, low-noise methods to integrate biochemical, proteomic, genomic, and ontological data; the first stages of which we have attempted in the present study. Although we have used I-DIRT to increase our chances of identifying bona fide interactors (Tackett et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2013), it is clear, and generally understood, that some proteins not making the significance cut-off will nevertheless prove to be critical to L1 activity (Byrum et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2013), such as demonstrated by our unexpected findings with IGF2BP1 (Supplementary file 2). Through further development, including reliable integration with diverse, publicly available interactome studies, we hope to enable the detection of extremely subtle physical and functional distinctions between (sub)complexes and their components, considerably enhancing reliable exploration and hypothesis formation. Furthermore, it is striking that no structures of assembled L1s yet exist; these are missing data that are likely to provide a profound advance for the mechanistic understanding of L1 molecular physiology. However, we believe that with the methods presented here, endogenously assembled ORF1p/ORF2p/L1-RNA-containing cytoplasmic L1 RNPs can be prepared at sufficiently high purity and yield (Figure 1F) to enable electron microscopy studies. Importantly, we have shown that our affinity captured fractions are enzymatically active for reverse transcription of the L1 RNA (Figure 2C; (Taylor et al., 2013)), providing some hope that cryo-electron microscopy could be used to survey the dynamic structural conformations of L1s formed during its various lifecycle stages (Takizawa et al., 2017)."

A circle with radius equal to the threshold was plotted. Points with distances higher than the threshold were marked as black. To plot split-tandem affinity capture results (Figure 1F), these data were normalized such that the ORF1p affinity was set to one and the distribution median was maintained. Probabilities associated with selected clusters were calculated based on the frequency distributions of 2- and 3-node clusters present in the data.

To determine the statistical significance of differentially co-captured proteins between EN- or RT- and WT, respectively, we used a 1-sample t-test and applied Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction. To determine the statistical significance of differentially co-captured proteins between EN- and RT- we used an unpaired t-test and applied Benjamini-Hochberg p-value correction. To plot in vitro dynamics (Figure 5B,C), only proteins which were identified at all time points were used. The cosine similarity method was used to calculate distances between proteins, and hierarchical clustering was used to visualize these distances. To integrate and plot the combined data (Figure 6), we calculated Euclidean and cosine distances for each I-DIRT-significant protein pair present in each experiment.

Extracted RNAs in water were then further purified and concentrated using a Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (#74204) following the manufacturerâs instructions, and eluted in 14 Âµl of nuclease-free water. 5 Âµl of purified RNA was used directly in RNA fragmentation. Libraries were prepared with unique barcodes and were pooled at equimolar ratios. The pool was denatured and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer using high output V2 reagents and NextSeq Control Software v1.4 to generate 75 bp single reads, following manufacturerâs protocols (#15048776, Rev.E)."
29309035_054,PMC5821459,METHOD,paragraph,"Human genome hg19 GRCh37.87 (FASTA) and annotation (GTF file) were downloaded from ENSEMBL (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/grch37/release-90) and reference FASTA and GTF files were created by combining the human genome and ORFeus-Hs from pLD401 (Taylor et al., 2013);Supplementary file 7: ORFeus-Hs_pLD401.gbk). To map sequencing reads onto the reference genome and produce differential gene expression analysis: (1) FASTAQ files were trimmed via trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014) using the following parameters: -phred33 -threads 8, LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:16 MINLEN:25; (2) mapping was performed via STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) version 2.5.3a (https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) using the following parameters: -runThreadN 8, --quantMode GeneCounts, --outSAMtype BAM SortedByCoordinate, --outFilterMatchNmin 30; (3) the results were output to one binary alignment map file for each sample matched to the reference; (4) genes with the coverage of 10 or more reads in at least three experiments were selected; and (5) data was normalized using the âDESeq2â (Love et al., 2014) R package version 1.14.1.

29309035_055,PMC5821459,METHOD,paragraph,"We generated an N-terminally acetylated, C-terminally amidated version of the ORF1p peptide (MENDFDELRE) as a di-peptide composed of repeats of the same sequence linked by a four-unit polyethylene glycol moiety; which was used to elute ORF1p-containing complexes from Î±-ORF1p medium at a concentration of approximately 2 mM (Appendix 1; Supplementary file 4). Peptides were synthesized by standard Fmoc solid-phase synthesis methods (Kates and Albericio, 2000); the incorporation of a PEG spacer into the peptide sequence was accomplished using N-Fmoc-amido-(PEG) n-acid building blocks. 400 mg of cryogenically milled L1-expressing cells (pLD401 and pLD561) were subjected to split-tandem affinity capture as described above, but with native elution from Î±-ORF1p medium and included the addition of RNasin (Promega #N2515) at 1:500 v/v to the extraction buffer; 1x protease inhibitors and 1:200 v/v RNasin were also added to the 3xFLAG peptide and ORF1p-derived di-peptide solutions. For Î±-FLAG affinity capture, competitive elution was achieved using 60 Î¼l of 1 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide. Of this, 20 Î¼l were held aside (Input), 40 Î¼l were carried forward to Î±-ORF1p affinity capture. The ORF1p-depleted fraction was retained (Sup) and the captured material was eluted with 40 Î¼l ORF1p di-peptide (Elu). Half of each fraction (Input, Sup, Elu) was set aside for protein analysis (Supplementary file 4) and to the other half, glycerol was added to 25% v/v (using a 50% v/v glycerol solution); the latter were subsequently analyzed for enzymatic activity by LEAP. Raw data resulting from these assays is located in Supplementary file 4. For LEAP, 2 Î¼l from each of the above-described fractions were used in a 50 Î¼l reaction, and 1 Î¼l of each LEAP assay was used in SYBR Green qPCR (carried out in triplicate) as previously described (Taylor et al., 2013). As controls, (1) an untagged L1RP construct was used in a âmock purification,â and (2) pLD401-derived âInputâ was heated at 100Â°C for 5 min and then added to the reaction mix, respectively. Neither produced detectable activity (Supplementary file 4). A second LEAP analysis was later carried out on an independently prepared set of fractions, prepared as above, stored frozen â80Â°C in 25% v/v glycerol."

29309035_057,PMC5821459,METHOD,paragraph,"For each microscope field, nuclei were identified and spatially located using a custom script in ImageJ, consisting of Otsu thresholding and watershed transformation of DAPI signal to segment each of the nuclei. ORF2p positive nuclei were differentiated from ORF2p negative nuclei by using another thresholding script for the ORF2p fluorescence channel and cross-registering the associated nuclei; all ORF2p positive nuclei were then hand-verified and then coordinates were converted into microns. The number of ORF2p+ nuclei per field, x, and a corresponding random distribution of x nuclei was calculated by randomly and repeatedly (nÂ =Â 1000) selecting x nuclei among all nuclei. The random distribution was used to calculate Bonferroni corrected p-values for the pairwise distances between ORF2p+ nuclei. The distribution of ORF2p+ inter nuclei distances was then compared to the distribution of random inter-nuclei distances using Welchâs t-test. The custom scripts used to select nuclei and calculate statistics, extracted data, calculated distances, p-values, and raw images are presented in the supplement (Supplementary file 5;Figure 3âsource data 1)."

(A) On-bead RNase-sensitivity assay: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. The magnetic media were then treated with a solution containing either a mixture of RNases A and T1 or BSA. After treatment, the supernatants were removed and the remaining bound material was released with LDS. Proteins requiring intact RNA to maintain stable interactions with immobilized ORF2p were released from the RNase-treated medium, while the BSA-treated sample controlled for the spontaneous release of proteins from the medium. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained gel lanes are shown for each fraction. (B) The experiments described above wereÂ carried out in duplicate, once with light isotopically labeled cells (L) and once with heavy isotopically labeled cells (H), resulting in four label-swapped, SILAC duplicates (one light set and one heavy set). The four fractions were cross-mixed and the differential protein retention upon the affinity medium during the treatments (BSA vs. RNase) was assessed by quantitative MS. (C) Results from the RNase-sensitivity assay graphed as the fraction of each detected protein present in the BSA-treated sample (RNase-sensitive proteins are more present in the BSA treated sample), normalized such that proteins that did not change upon treatment with RNases are centered at the origin. A cut-off of p=10â3 for RNase-sensitivity is indicated by a light gray circle; proteins that are RNase-sensitive with a statistical significance of p<10â3 are outside the circle. Proteins previously ranked significant by I-DIRT analysis (Table 1) are labeled and displayed in blue or magenta (as indicated); black nodes were RNase-sensitiveÂ butÂ not significant by I-DIRT; gray, unlabeled nodes were neither RNase-sensitiveÂ norÂ significant by I-DIRT. (D) Split-tandem affinity capture: L1 complexes were affinity captured by ORF2p-3xFLAG. After native elution with 3xFLAG peptide, this fraction was depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes using an Î±-ORF1 conjugated magnetic medium, resulting in a supernatant fraction depleted of ORF1p-containing complexes. The Î±-ORF1 bound material was then released with LDS, yielding an elution fraction enriched for ORF1p-containing complexes. Representative SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stained results for each fraction are shown. (E) SILAC duplicates, two supernatants and two elutions, were cross-mixed to enable an assessment of the relative protein content of each fraction by quantitative MS. (F) The results from split-tandem affinity capture graphed as the fraction of each protein observed in the elution sample. In order to easily visualize the relative degree of co-partitioning of constituent proteins with ORF1p, these data were normalized, setting the fraction of ORF1p in the elution to 1. Proteins which were previously ranked significant by I-DIRT analysis are labeled and displayed in blue or magenta (as indicated); gray, unlabeled nodes were not found to be significant by I-DIRT. MOV10 is marked with a dagger because in one replicate of this experiment it was detected by a single unique peptide, whereas we have enforced a minimum of two peptides (see Materials and methods) for all other proteins, throughout all other proteomic analyses presented here."

37924094_006,PMC10623882,INTRO,title_1,Background
37924094_007,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"Breast cancer (BC) is cancer that forms in normal breast tissues and can occur in men and women; however, it mainly occurs in women and threatens womenâs health [1]. BC involves lobules, ducts, and connective tissue of the breast and has different physiological properties and clinical outcomes [2]. Breast cancer can be divided into luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpressing, and TNBC. TNBC accounts for 15â20% of BCs [3]. Patients with TNBC showed a poorer prognosis than patients with other BCs [4]. Despite advanced interventions, relapse and metastasis of BC reduced survival rates. These interventions are not the best option for the treatment of BC metastasis [5]. Understanding BC tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways might help in the development of a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment [2]. BC stem cells (BCSCs) are BC subpopulations and play an important role in the metastasis of BC and resistance to chemotherapy [6]. BCSCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiate into cancer cells. Much data show that BCSCs cause tumor progression and drug resistance to conventional therapy [7, 8]. Targeting breast CSCs may be a good tool for BC treatment [9â11]."
37924094_008,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"BRD4 is a transcriptional and epigenetic factor that plays a vital role in embryogenesis and cancer development and is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family (BRD2, BRD3, and BRDT) [12]. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) supports tumor-driving oncogene expression. Since the BET family is a potential cancer therapeutic target, BET inhibitors are currently in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of multiple tumors [13]. BRD4 regulates the self-renewal ability of glioma-initiating cells by interaction in the Notch1 promoter region and involvement of tumor metabolism [14]. JQ1, BET (BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) inhibitor, represents the anti-BCSC activity [15]. BRD4 regulates the transcription factor â³Np63Î± to induce the CSC phenotype in squamous cell carcinoma [16]. However, whether the BRD4 signal is related to the formation of breast CSCs is unknown."
37924094_009,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) protein that is encoded by the CD274 gene in humans [17]. The PD- programmed cell death protein 11/PD-L1 axis inhibits T-cell activation and cytotoxic secretion in tumors, is responsible for the cancer immune escape, and makes a huge effect on cancer therapy [18]. PD-L1 plays an important role in inhibiting immune response by modulating T-cell activation and inducing apoptosis of antigen-specific T-cells. PD-L1 attenuates the host immune response to tumor cells. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is responsible for cancer immune escape and gives bad effects on cancer therapy [18]. PD-L1 is overexpressed on breast CSCs through the notch3/mTOR axis and enhanced colorectal cancer stem cell (CSC) formation by activating the HMGA1-dependent pathway [19, 20]. Immune checkpoint Inhibitor therapy is one of the most promising anticancer therapies. Antibodies against the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been applied to several cancers and have demonstrated good efficacy. Nevertheless, monotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 of metastatic BC showed a poor response [21]. The representative drug pembrolizumab contains an antibody that blocks PD-1 protein on the surface of T-cells, and chemotherapy as a first-line treatment is useful for the treatment of PD-L1-positive metastatic TNBC [22]. CSCs are not just resistant to chemotherapy but also immunotherapy. Whether the PL-L1 of CSCs is related to the formation of breast CSCs is unknown."
37924094_010,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"Transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) family regulating the immune responses have five members: c-Rel, p65 (RelA), RelB, p105/p50 (NF-ÎºB1), and p100/p52 (NF-ÎºB2) [23]. The NF-ÎºB pathway activation plays an important role in the progression of BC, and levels of RelB protein are known to be very high in aggressive BC tissues, particularly in TNBC. RelB induced cell mobility and inhibited apoptosis of BC [24]. RelB increased the proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through IMP3- and LIN28-mediated regulation [25]. The constitutive activated NF-ÎºB (p65/p50) has been seen in many tumor types and CSCs [26]. However, whether the RelB of CSCs is related to breast CSC formation is unknown."

We checked PD-L1 and the effect of the BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825). The expressions of PD-L1 of BC cells and CSCs were analyzed, and they expressed PD-L1 (Fig.Â 3A). JQ1 and ARV825 decreased the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 (Fig.Â 3B, C). A previous paper showed that PD-L1 is located in the cellular membrane and nucleus through endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways [29]. A research group reported that nuclear PD-L1 is independent of immune checkpoint function and inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth through sister chromatid cohesion of cancer cells [30]. In addition, we confirmed that the morphology of the chromosome was changed when treated with verteporfin and siRNA of PD-L1 (Fig. S1). Our data show that JQ1 and ARV-825 reduced the total, membrane, cytoskeleton, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bond nuclear levels of PD-L1 protein (Fig.Â 3D, E). Initially, we checked the transcript levels of PD-L1 under BRD4 inhibitor and degrader treatment. The PD-L1-Luc reporter assay showed that JQ1 and ARV825 inhibit PD-L1 promoter activity based on the luciferase reporter assay (Fig.Â 3F) and suppressed the BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter by BRD4-ChIP assay (Figs.Â 3G and S2). BRD4 inhibition and degradation inhibit promoter activity and BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter. To examine the effects of PD-L1 on CSC formation, we checked CSC formation through siRNA-mediated silencing PD-L1.

The NF-ÎºB pathway is a crucial factor in CSC formation and therapeutic target [26, 31]. As verteporfin decreases the intrinsic and interferon-induced PD-L1 expressions of six cancer cell lines [32], we checked the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 under verteporfin treatment.

As nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expression of RelB and the NF-ÎºB pathway is a crucial factor of CSC formation, we checked the transcript and protein levels of RelB under verteporfin treatment. Verteporfin reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB at the same concentration that reduced PD-L1 (Fig.Â 4B). To investigate the function of RelB in breast CSC formation, we used BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (RV825). JQ1 and ARV825 reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB (Fig.Â 4C).

37924094_041,PMC10623882,RESULT,paragraph,"RelB/p65 (RelA) complex promotes NF-ÎºB target genes such as TNF and IL-6 in ER-negative BC [34]. We examined the interaction of RelB and p65 to understand the CSC regulation of RelB. FigureÂ 5Â A shows that RelB and p65 (RelA) interact with each other. The downregulation of p65 using siRNA of p65 reduced the mammosphere formation of BC (Fig.Â 5B). We used caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) to investigate CSC regulation by nuclear p65 activity. CAPE has strong inhibitory effects on NF-ÎºB activation through the inhibition of NF-ÎºB p65 phosphorylation [35]. We assayed cell proliferation, mammosphere formation, and nuclear localization of p65 using CAPE (Fig.Â 5C). Our results showed that CAPE did not change cell proliferation, but inhibited mammosphere formation and nuclear localization of p65. CSC formation is regulated by the nuclear location of p65, the NF-ÎºB component. Cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, regulated by NF-ÎºB proteins regulated breast CSC population [36]. The levels of CSC-regulating cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were examined under a BRD4 inhibitor, PD-L1 inhibitor, RelB inhibitor, and p65 inhibitor treatments. The RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) and p65 inhibitor (CAPE) only inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig.Â 6A). The BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and PD-L1 inhibitor (verteporfin) also inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig.Â 6B, C). Then, we performed the ChIP assay to identify RelB and p65 binding of the IL-6 promoter using a PCR primer set spanning the IL-6 promoter (Figs.Â 6D and S3). RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) endogenously reduced the IL-6 promoter binding affinity of RelB and p65. The IL-6 gene of breast CSCs is regulated by RelB and p65 protein through the binding of the IL-6 promoter. Secretory IL-6 and IL-8 play essential roles in mammosphere formation. To assess the production of secretory IL-6 and IL-8, we performed a human inflammatory cytokine assay on mammosphere-cultured broth using cytokine assay beads. The human inflammatory cytokine data indicated that inhibitors only reduce the production of secretory IL-6, not IL-8 (Fig.Â 6E). We performed the rescue experiments using the PD-L1 overexpression plasmid to understand the role of the existence of the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis in breast CSCs. For the rescue of BRD4-dependent PD-L1 degradation, the PD-L1_GFP expression vector was transfection into breast cancer cells with/without ARV-825 (BRD4 degrader). BRD4 degrader reduced BRD4, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels and overexpression of PD-L1 of ARV-825 treated breast cancers increased reduced PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels (Fig.Â 6F).

As THF has an anti-proliferative effect on MC-38 cells, we used an in vivo mouse model to examine whether it reduces tumor growth (Fig.Â 9A and Fig. S5A). The body weights of the control and THF-treated C57BL/6 and BALB/c murine mice did not change (Fig.Â 9B and Fig. S5B). The weights and volume of tumors from THF-treated C57BL/6 and THF-treated BALB/c murine were lower and small than those of tumors from control C57BL/6 and BALB/c murine (Fig.Â 9B and Fig. S5B). To demonstrate the effect of THF on MC-38 and 4T1 tumor in vivo, we performed Western blotting of the resected tumor tissue. Reduced expressions of c-myc, PD-L1, and RelB proteins were observed in THF-treated MC38 tumor tissues compared with the control group (Fig.Â 9C and Fig. S5C). Our results indicated that THF effectively reduced tumor growth.

37924094_050,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
37924094_051,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"CSCs have been isolated and established from human tumors and are the driving forces of tumor recurrence and metastasis [41, 42]. Targeting CSC self-renewal or stemness was known as an effective cancer therapy [43]. Previous reports have shown that combined inhibition of BRD4 and RAC1 suppresses growth, stemness, and tumorigenesis by disrupting the c-MYC/G9a/FTH1axis [44]. In this study, we examined the biological function of targeting BRD4 using siRNA, inhibitor, and degrader on breast CSCs. We showed that the siRNA for BRD4, a specific inhibitor of BET family proteins (JQ1), and BRD4 protein degrader (ARV-825) suppress mammosphere formation, ALDH1 activity, CD44+/CD24â subpopulation, CSC growth, and specific survival factor of CSCs. The expression level of CSC BRD4 is higher than that in BCs (Figs.Â 1 and 2). BRD4 participates in breast CSC formation and the tumorigenic activity of MC38 derived from tumors (Figs.Â 1 and 9)."
37924094_052,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"BRD4 can regulate PD-L1 expression in TNBC [45]. We examined the biological function of PD-L1 by targeting PD-L1 using siRNA, BRD4 inhibitors (JQ1 and ARV-825), and PD-L1 degrader (verteporfin) on breast CSCs. We found that siRNA for PD-L1, a specific inhibitor of BET family proteins (JQ1), and BRD4 protein degrader (ARV-825) suppress mammosphere formation. BRD4 inhibition reduced the expression levels of the membrane, cytoskeleton, and nuclear fraction (Fig.Â 3). For the first time, we showed that nuclear PD-L1 regulated mammosphere formation. PD-L1 or B7-H1 is well known for its role in immune checkpoint regulation as membrane function. Nuclear PD-L1 of cancer cells regulated the sister chromatid cohesion of BC and was independent of its function in the immune checkpoint [30]. Nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expressions of NF-ÎºB signaling (BIRC3, RelB, and TRAP1), MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-H), and immune checkpoint (PD-L2, VISTA, and B&-H3) [29]. NF-ÎºB signaling is essential for breast CSC formation. We checked whether verteporfin (a PD-L1 degrader) can downregulate the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Verteporfin downregulated the transcript and protein levels of RelB (Fig.Â 4). The siRNA and inhibitor of RelB (calcitriol) suppressed mammosphere formation, and for the first time, we showed that RelB regulated mammosphere formation. The RelB/RelA (p65) complex promotes the transcript of the NF-kB target gene and IL-6 gene of ER-negative BC [34]. RelB interacts with RelA (p65), and the RelB/RelA (p65) complex binds the promoter sequence of the IL-6 gene (Fig.Â 6). A new finding is that the RelB protein regulates breast CSC formation through IL-6 regulation. Our results indicated that RelB may be a potential target of BC therapy."
37924094_053,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Recently, studies on cytokine-modulated tumor microenvironments and BCSCs have focused on the mechanisms of chemoresistance [46]. IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment can regulate the self-renewal and survival of breast CSCs. Our data showed that the inhibitors of BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/p65 reduced the levels of secretory IL-6 in breast CSCs (Figs.Â 6 and 7). The combinational therapeutic strategy of targeting breast CSCs and neutralizing IL-6 may be a good chance to enhance the survival of patients with BC. Our experiment showed that BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis regulated breast CSCs formation and it was confirmed by the rescue experiments using the PD-L1 overexpression plasmid (Fig.Â 6F)."
37924094_054,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our experiment showed that the inhibition of the PD-L1 pathway results in anti-CSC and antitumor conditions. We used MC38 colorectal cancer cells and 4T1 breast cancer cells, which are sensitive to PD-L1 monotherapy and express PDL-1 and IL-6 [40]. We examined the relationship between PD-L1 and CSC formation on MC38 colorectal cancer, MC38-derived tumor, and 4T1-derived tumor using THF, a natural compound of BRD4 inhibitor. CSCs from MC38 colorectal cancer and MC38-derived tumors showed that THF inhibited CSC formation and induced apoptosis of MC38-derived CSCs through the c-Myc/BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL6 axis (Fig.Â 8). THF reduced the MC38-derived and 4T1-derived tumor volume and weight, and the inhibitor-treated tumor showed reduced expression levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. The strategy of targeting BC and breast CSCs using a natural BRD4 inhibitor may help promote the survival of patients with BC."
37924094_055,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"PD-L1 on MC38 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and 4T1 breast cancer cells is sufficient to suppress antitumor immunity through tumor immune evasion or correlates with an inflamed tumor microenvironment and inhibits CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity. To evaluate the significance of PD-L1 and BRD4 inhibitor on tumors, we used a mouse tumor model sensitive to PD-1 blockade [40]. To examine the in vivo treatment effect of THF, we checked the levels of CD3â+âCD4â+âand CD3â+âCD8â+âT-cells in TIL and TDLNs. THF increased the levels of CD3â+âCD4â+âand CD3â+âCD8â+âT-cells in TIL and TDLNs. ICB (anti-PD-L1) and BRD4 inhibitor THF showed a similar anticancer effect."

So far, accumulation of neutrophils and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aimed to compare circulatory levels of neutrophil secretory proteins, alpha-defensins (DEFA1), calprotectin (S100A8/A9), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations. We studied 19 healthy subjects, 63 COVID-19 patients with mild (n=32) and severe (n=31) disease, 23 asymptomatic individuals identified through contact tracing programme and 23 recovering patients (1-4 months post-disease). At the time of disease presentation, serum levels of DEFA1 were significantly higher in patients with mild (mean230 \u00b1 17, p<0.0001) and severe (mean452 \u00b1 46, p<0.0001) disease respectively in comparison to healthy subjects (mean113 \u00b1 11). S100A8/A9 proteins were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (p<0.0001) irrespective of disease severity. The levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO reduced to normal in recovering patients and comparable to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, DEFA1 levels were higher in severe than mild patients in first week of onset of disease (p=0.004). Odds-ratio analysis showed that DEFA1 could act as potential biomarker in predicting disease severity (OR=11.34). In addition, levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 were significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (p=0.004 and p=0.03) respectively. The rise in DEFA1 levels was independent of secondary infections. In conclusion, our data suggest that induction of elevated levels of alpha-defensins and S100A8/A9 is associated with poor disease outcome in COVID-19 patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2023, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2036, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "COVID-19 is a recently emerged viral disease caused by a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

During airway infections, neutrophils are the first line of defense. In response to viral infection, neutrophils migrate to the site of infection and initiate the antiviral defense mechanism. Recent studies have reported accumulation of neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients compared to non-severe patients. In a COVID-19 patient with fatal outcome, large number of neutrophils were found in autopsied lung infiltrates. Moreover, increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggest that neutrophil activation may modulate immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon neutrophil activation or death, alarmins including alpha-defensins, S100A8/A9 heterodimers (calprotectin) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) proteins are released extracellularly in circulation. Till date, COVID-19 pathogenesis has focused on macrophages, T and B cells. It has been suggested that neutrophilia is associated with disease severity in COVID-19.

At the site of infection, neutrophils can exert their antiviral activities by increasing the expression of peptides such as, defensins and promote degranulation.

The molecular stoichiometry of protein to nucleic acid is often difficult to assess, particularly by standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Here, we investigate the use of composition-gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) for quantifying binding affinity and stoichiometry for two RNA-binding proteins with their nucleic acid partners of varied sequence and length: TDP43\u2019s N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with both TG/GU-repeat ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, and CELF1\u2019s two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with (TG/UGUU/GU) repeats and an experimentally defined cognate GU-rich element (GRE). Our CG-MALS data derived from each of these interactions is consistent with expected ranges of binding affinity and stoichiometry for proteins binding to shorter nucleic acid repeats.

Many homotypic and heterotypic protein\u2013protein interactions and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions utilize multivalency to facilitate cooperativity and achieve cellular signaling (e.g., refs (\u2212)). For example, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP-43 assemble in multiples upon UG-rich elements of various length, and alterations in the stoichiometric ratios between the protein and its RNA target may have significant consequences regarding normal cellular function. However, current methods still present challenges in providing robust quantitative estimates of the molecular stoichiometry. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), a widely used technique in protein\u2013nucleic acid studies, require optimization of gel conditions to generate distinct bands. Even with optimized conditions, the number of bands is not formally indicative of the correct stoichiometry. Other biophysical techniques, such as fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or biolayer interferometry (BLI), are indirect methods (i.e., based on changes in fluorescence, enthalpy heat, or \u201cresponse units\u201d with complex formation). They are generally best suited for quantifying interactions with a 1:1 stoichiometry and can suffer from artifacts for more complex interactions. For example, ITC may not readily distinguish between 1:1 and 2:2 stoichiometric ratios of molecular complexes. In contrast, multiangle static light scattering (MALS) measurements provide a label-free method of directly accessing the molecule\u2019s molar mass, thus directly measuring the essence of complex formation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2925, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Composition-gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) leverages the fact that changes in molar mass can be directly related to the reversible formation and dissociation of specific complexes, each with its own equilibrium association constant. In a typical experiment, each binding partner is prepared in solution at concentrations near the expected equilibrium constant of the interaction. Solutions of varying compositions are prepared automatically, injected into a multiangle light scattering (MALS) detector, and allowed to come to equilibrium inside the MALS flow cell for a user-specified amount of time. The weight-average molar mass (Mw) of the solution is a first-principles calculation based on the light scattering intensity and total concentration of the solution\u2014either specified manually or measured using an inline concentration detector. Association of one species with itself or with a binding partner results in a concentration-dependent increase in Mw; thus, multivalent complex formation is readily evident. The measured Mw as a function of composition is fitted to the appropriate expressions describing the equilibrium association of the analytes, which can include both self-interaction (e.g., dimerization) and heteroassociation. Like AUC or ITC, all interactions occur in solution without the need for immobilization or labeling. CG-MALS can be used to measure interactions with the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) from \u223c100 pM to several mM and has been used to quantify a wide variety of biomolecular interactions, including the self-association of insulin, antibody\u2013antigen interactions, and multivalent interactions with complex stoichiometries. The measured stoichiometry and affinity by CG-MALS agree well with other techniques, including SPR, BLI, AUC, ITC, and CryoEM.

EMSA provides qualitative evidence that TDP43 binds to both (TG)6 and (GT)12. For (TG)6, we observe the disappearance of the free ssDNA and the consequent smearing of the lanes with faint bands corresponding to bound states (Figure 1a).

Even when the binding interactions become significantly more complex and involve high stoichiometric ratios (>2), the Mw,max can provide minimum estimates of molecular stoichiometric ratios. Better quantitative estimates can be obtained with CG-MALS data simulations and estimated Kd values from experimental studies for both simple stoichiometry (\u22642) and complex interactions by combining data across multiple concentration ranges. Thus, CG-MALS could be a useful technique in investigating the molecular stoichiometry involved in large multivalent protein\u2013nucleic acid complexes.

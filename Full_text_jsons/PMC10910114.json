The heat map was generated using Z-scores (calculation provided in materials and methods) without normalization, clustered into groups based on protein sets exhibiting positive Z-scores in each group. Protein-protein interaction networks of enriched proteins were generated using enriched proteins detected by LC-MS/MS in (C) 2K, (D) 10K, and (E) 100K fractions of Leishmania major-derived EVs. Notable protein clusters for each fraction included: (C) Histone Complex, Signal Transduction, Transcription/Ribosomal, and Cellular Respiration in the 2K fraction; (D) no notable clusters in the 10K fraction; and (E) clusters associated to Endoplasmic Glycosylation, Cysteine Pathway, and Vacuolar Sorting/ESCRT pathway in the 100K fraction. Protein-protein interaction networks of the identified proteins were created using String database () using the highest confidence of interaction (>0.900), showing only connected proteins in the network and using an MCL inflation parameter of 3.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 23578, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1",

In contrast, no significant interaction networks could be identified for the 10K fraction, likely due to few enriched proteins identified within the fraction ( Figure\u00a04D ). Enriched proteins in the 100K fraction formed three main clusters: endoplasmic glycosylation, cysteine pathway, and vacuolar sorting/ESCRT pathway ( Figures\u00a04C, E ).

Each plot showed a distinct protein expression spread, identifying proteins significantly enriched in each EV fraction. For example, when comparing the 2K and 100K fractions, proteins related to aerobic metabolism, notably citrate synthase and ATP synthase, were significantly enriched within the 2K fraction, whereas important parasitic virulence factors, like EF-1, GP63, and superoxide dismutase, were enriched within the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Figure\u00a02 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Furthermore, this same enrichment of parasitic virulence factors in the 100K fraction was observed in comparison to the 10K fraction, with additional enrichment of VPS4, an important component of the ESCRT complex. Additionally, this analysis identified cellular metabolic pathway-related proteins enriched within the 10K fraction as compared to the 100K fraction, particularly enzymes related to glycolysis and the citrate cycle, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and citrate synthase ( Supplementary Figure\u00a02 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Finally, when comparing the 2K and 10K fraction proteomes, enrichment of citrate cycle proteins, such as citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, was observed in the 2K fraction, while the 10K fraction displayed enrichment of glycolysis-related proteins like enolase and pyruvate kinase ( Supplementary Figure\u00a02 ;  Data Sheet 3 ).

Both HSP83 and HSP70 were identified in all three EV fractions, with similar expression levels. In fact, while HSP70 was slightly upregulated in the 10K fraction, this was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no significant variation in the expression levels of EF-1, Tryparedoxin peroxidase, Calpain-like cysteine peptidase, and 14-3-3 protein between the fractions. GP63, Enolase, and Surface Antigen Protein did, however, show an increasing trend in expression from the 2K to the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Table\u00a04 ).

These results are in agreement with Kowal et\u00a0al.\u2019s work on dendritic cell-derived EVs, whereby homogenous EV populations with distinct morphological characteristics were recovered in each fraction, though they recovered larger populations of small EVs (<200 nm). This is likely due to the methodology underlying leishmanial exosome isolation, as a temperature shift is used to stimulate EV production, inducing the packaging of heat shock proteins and large stress-induced cargo.

While mitochondrial proteins formed an important cluster in the 10K fraction, exocytosis and MVB formation associated proteins were unique to the 100K fraction \u2013 an observation which validates the origin of the small extracellular vesicles, as these functions are directly related to known pathways for the intracellular formation and outtake of exosomes by eukaryotic cells. However, mitochondrial-related proteins would have been expected in the 2K fraction rather than the 10K fraction, considering apoptotic bodies use mitochondrial pathways for their formation. This finding is likely due to the overlap of intermediate and large-sized vesicles during the isolation process, with potential precipitation of larger vesicles within the 10K fractions or co-precipitation of free mitochondrial fragments along with this fraction. Though this highlights a potential technical limitation of EV isolation, Gene Ontology Analysis (PANTHER-db) revealed an overall decrease of proteins of mitochondrial origin from the 2K fraction to the 10K fraction, indicating that the 2K fraction is the most enriched in apoptotic bodies. Further, proteins of vacuolar origin are most abundant in the 100K fraction, suggesting the presence of exosomes, as their biogenesis requires the formation of vacuoles within multivesicular bodies using the ESCRT pathway.

This not only confirms that minimal contamination by the other class of EVs occurred in the extremum fractions, but also highlights the vastly different roles these EVs play. Further, moderate overlap of the 10K fraction with both the 2K and 10K fraction suggests the presence of low numbers of other EV populations, though a clearly enriched set of proteins indicates relative purity of the preparation. PPI analysis of enriched protein sets permitted the identification of clusters related to the Histone Complex, Signal Transduction, Transcription/Ribosomal, and Cellular Respiration in the 2K complex. In contrast, clusters related to Endoplasmic Glycosylation, the Cysteine Pathway, and the Vacuolar Sorting/ESCRT pathway were identified in the 100K fraction ( Figures\u00a04C, E ). This observation reiterates the importance of the ESCRT pathway in exosome formation within the cell \u2013 a pathway that has been experimentally demonstrated by several research groups. Although the association between exosomes and both the endoplasmic glycosylation and cysteine pathways is less clear, these clusters may be due to the importance of the ER and the Golgi apparatus in cargo sorting before packaging and trafficking into exosomes.

While serial differential ultracentrifugation does not permit the recovery of completely homogenous EV fractions, should this non-specificity be a result of exosomal contamination in other EV fractions, lower abundance of these canonical markers would be expected in larger EV fractions. Thus, the similar abundance of HSP70 and HSP83 across EV populations suggests that this is not an artifact of contamination, but rather the result of the proteins being packaged in all EVs.

Available data on the immune responsiveness of MF patients to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and the impact of the therapy with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, are still fragmented. Here, we profile the spike-specific IgG and memory B-cell response in MF patients, treated or not with ruxolitinib, after the second and the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples were collected before vaccination, post the second and the third doses and tested for spike-specific antibodies, ACE2/RBD antibody inhibition binding activity and spike-specific B cells. The third vaccine dose significantly increased the spike-specific IgG titers in both ruxolitinib-treated and untreated patients, and strongly enhanced the percentage of subjects with antibodies capable of in vitro blocking ACE2/RBD interaction, from 50% up to 80%. While a very low frequency of spike-specific B cells was measured in blood 7 days after the second vaccination dose, a strong and significant increase was elicited by the third dose administration, generating a B cell response similar to the one detected in healthy controls. Despite the overall positive impact of the third dose in MF patients, two patients that were under active concomitant immunosuppressive treatment at the time of vaccination, and a patient that received lymphodepleting therapies in the past, remained low responders. The third mRNA vaccine dose strongly increases the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and B cell responses in MF patients, promoting a reactivation of the immune response similar to the one observed in healthy controls.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1939, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1952, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Patients with hematologic malignancies are at an increased risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and report highest disease severity and death rates compared to the general population. Booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been highly recommended and prioritized in fragile categories including patients with myelofibrosis (MF), a clonal hematopoiesis stem cell disorder belonging to the Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). MF is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, progressive cytopenia, and extramedullary hematopoiesis, with complications as anemia, opportunistic infections, and ultimately progression to leukemia in a fraction of patients. MF patients may receive clinical benefits from ruxolitinib, the first approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that deeply reduces inflammatory cytokine production and impairs to some extent cellular immune responses. Indeed, ruxolitinib has been successfully employed in attenuating the cytokine storm responsible of fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 disease, as reported by several studies. On the other hand, the interruption of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected MF patients has been followed by an increase in death rate, probably due to the cytokine rebound subsequent to the drug suspension.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3290, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We previously demonstrated a slower kinetic of antibody response in MF patients vaccinated with two doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared to healthy subjects, and a reduced ACE2/RBD inhibition binding capacity of plasma antibodies, especially in concomitance with ruxolitinib treatment.

Public health agencies have advised the administration of a booster dose 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination is completed, to strengthen protection against serious illness and death from COVID-19, especially for fragile patients. Several studies have described the effect of the third vaccine dose on the humoral immune response and on the protection from infections, without relevant adverse events. We recently provided evidence that a third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine, in subjects primed with two doses of the same vaccine, substantially increase SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and B-cell response in low responder hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients, emphasizing the importance of an additional vaccine dose for those who may have produced a low response upon the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccination. The administration of the third dose has opened the door to heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination approaches, obtained by the combination of vector- and mRNA-based vaccines, or mixed mRNA platforms. Here, the cohort of MF patients included 17 subjects vaccinated with homologous mRNA vaccines and only 2 primed with Spikevax and boosted with Comirnaty mRNA vaccine, therefore it was not possible to make a comparison of immunogenicity between the different prime-boost strategies. Nevertheless, data obtained in healthy subjects support the heterologous combination as a successful strategy for improving immunogenicity and safety, as well as a practical solution to shortages of some vaccines, or to changes in national authorization for some initially licensed vaccines (Pastore et al, in preparation).

The characterization of the spike-specific B cell response is particularly relevant since the ability of memory B cells to be promptly re-activated by pathogen encounter and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmacells, capable of secreting virus neutralizating antibodies. This booster effect was particularly relevant for MF patients that were low responder after the second vaccine dose, independently from ruxolitinib treatment, as reported also by Caocci et\u00a0al. in MF patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Our findings demonstrate that a third dose of mRNA vaccine considerably enhances spike-specific antibody and B-cell response in MF patients, regardless of therapy with ruxolitinib. Data highlight the importance of the third vaccine dose to strongly boost immune response for those who may have achieved a limited response to the primary cycle of COVID-19 vaccination. This knowledge is crucial to assess the need for additional booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines and to guide vaccination policies designed for MF patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33411, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Data availability statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33439, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33561, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Ethics statement", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 33578, "infons": {"section_type": "SUPPL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and the protocol was approved by local Ethical Committee for Clinical experimentation of Regione Toscana Area Vasta Sud Est (CEASVE), protocol code 19479 PATOVAC COV v1.0, approved on March 15th 2021, and protocol code 18869 IMMUNO_COV v1.0, approved on November 18th 2020.

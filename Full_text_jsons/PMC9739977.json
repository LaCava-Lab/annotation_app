Platelet-mediated issues can occur in blood vessels and trigger various medical problems. Therefore, controlling platelet function is important in the prevention of thrombosis. In this regard, we need to find compounds that provide potent antiplatelet activity with minimum side effects. Therefore, we examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one isolated from Protaetia brevitarsis larvae having antiplatelet properties and investigated different pathways that mediate the antiplatelet activity. We examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) on the regulation of phosphoproteins, thromboxane A2 generation, and integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 action. Our data showed that human platelet aggregation was inhibited by 5-HI (75, 100, 150, 200 \u03bcM) without cytotoxicity, and it suppressed intracellular Ca2+ concentration through the regulation of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor I (Ser1756) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, collagen-elevated thromboxane A2 production and \u03b1IIb\u03b23 action were inhibited by 5-HI through the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (protein kinase B).

CVD includes various diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. Among the 18.6 million CVD deaths worldwide in 2019, 58% occurred in Asia. The Korean Society of Cardiology has recently published the Korea Heart Disease Fact Sheet 2020 and showed that CVD mortality has increased during the last decade in Korea. In addition, many studies are being conducted in Korea to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular disease and other diseases and various lifestyles. Among several risk factors of CVD, platelet mediated thrombosis is one of the most important factors, and various antiplatelet drugs are used to improve cardiovascular disease. Under normal circulatory conditions, platelets can play a vital role in maintaining hemostasis; however, aberrant platelet activation may cause thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Platelet aggregation in the blood vessels is central to the development of thrombosis; thus, the regulation of the platelet is important in preventing cardiovascular issues. Therefore, current antithrombosis therapies target platelet inhibition pathways. Collagen from damaged blood vessel activates platelets hydrolyze membrane phospholipids to inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3), and IP3 is liberated into the cytoplasm. [Ca2+]i mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum is controlled by IP3 receptor type I (IP3RI) on the surface of endoplasmic reticulum. At the same time, depletion of the [Ca2+]i level causes Ca2+ influx, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) regulates the influx. Elevated [Ca2+]i level facilitates granule release, and activated platelets produce thromboxane A2 (TXA2), leading to thrombus formation. These actions finally activate glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (\u03b1IIb/\u03b23) after signal transduction processes, and \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 leads to the formation of platelet meshes at the site of damage to blood vessels.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3741, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Insects have been considered as drug resources, and many insects are being used in Oriental medicine.

In order to verify the effect of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae, research on the component analysis has been conducted and alkaloid components were discovered.

Thrombosis, a representative symptom of cardiovascular disease, is caused by an abnormal increase in thrombosis due to coagulation factors and platelet activation, which interferes with normal blood flow. Antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and thrombolytic drugs are currently utilized for the prevention of thrombotic diseases. However, aspirin, an antiplatelet agent, has been reported to cause side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration. Therefore, it is necessary to find new potential substances without side effects, and the candidate substances should be evaluated for their antiplatelet effect, anticoagulation effect, and thrombolytic activity. The current study of insects has been focused mainly on the value of edible insects as a new alternative resource for bioactive molecules. Protaetia brevitarsis larvae have traditionally been used in alternative medicine to cure toxic epilepsy, thrush, and tetanus. Regarding the anticoagulant action, it has been reported that administration of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae ethanol extract showed antithrombotic efficacy in the rat, and insect-derived alkaloids prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT).

Thus, we investigated whether 5-HI inhibited [Ca2+]i levels through the phosphorylation of IP3RI and dephosphorylation of ERK. Our data showed that 5-HI strongly suppressed [Ca2+]i levels through the phosphorylation of IP3RI and dephosphorylation of ERK (Figure 2A\u2013D).

Various signaling events facilitate integrin activation, leading to the structural change of \u03b1IIb/\u03b23. Activated platelets interact with other platelets via \u03b1IIb/\u03b23, and as a result, another signaling mechanism begins inside the platelets. This signaling action is called the outside-in signaling pathway. Regarding the activation of \u03b1IIb/\u03b23, PI3K/Akt and VASP are the crucial mediators. Therefore, we investigated whether 5-HI suppresses \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 action by the dephosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and phosphorylation of VASP (Ser157). The use of 5-HI suppressed \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 affinity (Figure 4A\u2013C), decreased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4D,E), and increased VASP phosphorylation (Ser157) (Figure 4F). The cAMP and cGMP act as negative feedback molecules within the platelet. The cAMP and cGMP are generated by adenylate and guanylate cyclase for antiplatelet function and are decomposed by phosphodiesterases. These molecules can elevate the phosphorylation of VASP (Ser157, Ser239) and IP3RI (Ser1756). In our study, 5-HI increased only the cAMP level (Figure 5A), and these changes can block the \u03b1IIb/\u03b23 action. Next, we investigated whether 5-HI can affect \u03b1IIb/\u03b23-mediated fibrin clot retraction. As shown in Figure 5B,C, 5-HI strongly inhibited the clot retraction. Our study had some limitations: 5-HI increased the cAMP level in human platelets, and the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is thought to be due to increased cAMP. However, 5-HI also affected the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and cPLA2; this phosphorylation is not related to the increase in cAMP. Therefore, we could not clearly determine whether the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is due to the increase in cAMP or if it can regulate all proteins in turn. Additionally, all of our studies were conducted in vitro. Although the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is strong, it is difficult to predict the effect in the human body. The in vivo antiplatelet effect of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae ethanol extract has not been studied, and the in vivo bioactivity effect of 5-HI should also be evaluated in the future. However, 5-HI showed an effect in an in vivo bleeding test and delayed thrombus in an ex vivo coagulation test. Therefore, based on the results, we suggest that 5-HI has the potential to inhibit thrombosis-mediated cardiovascular disease. Various laboratory data have shown that medicinal plants may have therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease, and it has been identified that Ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and Ganoderma lucidum have potential effects on cardiovascular disease in vitro and in vivo. A randomized clinical trial was conducted on the use of Ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants in cardiovascular disease have not been clinically observed. However, coadministration of traditional cardiovascular disease drugs and natural products has shown potential for the inhibition of cardiovascular disease, and several clinical trials in cardiovascular disease are still ongoing. In our previous study, ginsenosides showed strong antiplatelet effects, and their inhibitory concentrations were similar to those of 5-HI.

It\u2019s been reported that an acute decrease in ZnT8 levels impairs \u03b2 cell function and Zn++ homeostasis, which contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although ZnT8 expression has been detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), its expression profile in the retina has yet to be determined. Furthermore, the link between diabetes and ischemic retinopathy is well documented; nevertheless, the molecular mechanism(s) of such link has yet to be defined. Our aims were to; investigate the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina; address the influence of ischemia on such expression; and evaluate the influence of YC-1; (3-(50-hydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole), a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) inhibitor, on the status of ZnT8 expression. We used real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and M\u00fcller cells to evaluate the effects of ischemia/hypoxia and YC-1 on ZnT8 expression. Our data indicate that ZnT8 was strongly expressed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and nerve fiber layer (NFL), whereas the photoreceptor layer (PRL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) showed moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that retinal ischemic insult induces a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the message and protein levels, YC-1 rescues the injured retina by restoring the ZnT8 to its basal homeostatic levels in the neovascular retinas. Our data indicate that ischemic retinopathy maybe mediated by aberrant Zn++ homeostasis caused by ZnT8 downregulation, whereas YC-1 plays a neuroprotective role against ischemic insult. Therefore, targeting ZnT8 provides a therapeutic strategy to combat neovascular eye diseases.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2035, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2048, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Zinc (Zn++) is the second most abundant transition metal in mammals. Since Zn++ is utilized in a number of biological processes, its homeostasis is tightly controlled on both; the systemic and cellular levels via different mechanisms. Zinc homeostasis is regulated by an array of zinc transporters, controlling its movement from the extracellular space to the cytosol, and from the cytosol to intravesicular space. Two types of transporters exist; zinc transporter (ZnT) and Zrt- and Irt-like proteins (ZIP). There are 10 ZnTs (SLC30A) and 14 ZIPs (SLC39A), which have been identified in mammals with different tissue expression, cellular localization and regulation, and their expression is dependent on tissue and cellular status. The SLC30A efflux is localized in the membrane of the insulin secretory vesicles and it facilitates the accumulation of zinc from the cytoplasm into the insulin-containing vesicles. It plays a major role in providing zinc for insulin maturation and/or storage processes. Whereas the SCL39A influx transporter family, Zrt-Irt-like Protein (ZIP) acts in an opposing manner to increase intracellular Zn++ levels. A major role of Zn++ in the pathogenesis of DM is not surprising since Zn in \u03b2 cell secretory vesicles is essential for insulin hexamerization. This is supported by the findings that polymorphism in a genetic variant of ZnT8 (SLC30A8) is associated with increased risk of type 2 DM (T2DM). Furthermore, ZnT8 (SLC30A8) has been reported as an auto-antigen and a major susceptibility gene for type 1DM (T1DM) and T2DM, respectively. These autoantibodies are present in 60\u201380% of new cases of T1DM. Dysregulation in Zn++ homeostasis is firmly implicated in the pathophysiology of many acute neural injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, perturbations in Zn++ homeostasis disrupt carbohydrate metabolism; however, the inverse relationship is also true: DM and hyperglycemia alter Zn++ balance, promoting hypozincemia and hyperzincuria. The importance of Zn++ in biological processes is crucial to housekeeping proteins, cellular metabolism, and gene expression. It provides structural stability to the Zn++ finger domains of many DNA-binding proteins and is a cofactor for more than 300 metalloenzymes, in which it is an essential element for the catalytic and/or structural integrity. Beta cells have insulin-containing vesicles, which also contain high intracellular concentrations of Zn++. Furthermore, Zn++ facilitates the packaging of insulin into hexamers through two Zn++ ions, a step necessary for insulin crystallization.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 4644, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Chimienti and co-workers originally described the zinc transporter encoded by SLC30A8; ZnT8, as a pancreatic islet-expressed protein is associated with the ZnT family of intracellular Zn++ transports. Loss of ZnT8 from pancreatic \u03b2 cells reduces insulin content and compromises insulin release. Interest in the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of DM was re-erupted with the discovery of the association between T2DM and a genetic polymorphism in the SLC30A8 gene. This polymorphism, which is caused by the minor allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1226634 (C/T transition; Arg {325}\u2013Trp 273 {325}), was subsequently shown to be associated with the presence of altered glucose homeostasis, pancreatic \u03b2 cell dysfunction, or overt T2DM in many but not all study populations. Furthermore, the insulin producing pancreatic \u03b2 cells contain some of the highest levels of Zn++ in the body. This high Zn++ content is largely due to the critical function of Zn++ for insulin synthesis, secretion and signaling, and the role that may play in the protection against oxidative stresses. Zinc deficiency may predispose individuals to DM and its cardiovascular complications. Overall, ZnT8 may contribute to the pathogenesis of DM due to autoantigenic properties as well as decreased protein function, which may be exacerbated by polymorphic variance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 6002, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Zn++ plays an essential role in the retinal function; this is echoed by its relatively high content in ocular tissue with the retinal being the highest.

In addition interactions between Zn++ and the antioxidant amino acid taurine have long been addressed. Recent studies have indicated that the intracellular localization of Zn++ pools in photoreceptors changes with light exposure, with the greatest intensity of Zn++ staining observed in the perikarya of photoreceptors of dark-adapted retinas and in the inner segments of light-adapted retinas.

In this study, we have employed the OIR mouse model for various reasons: 1) This model depicts the human retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); 2) It represents an ischemia-dependent model, which manifests the overexpression of HIF-1, the main causation of retinal ischemia; 3) It manifests retinal vasculopathy, i.e., the development of retinal NV; 4) Ischemia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Recent findings strongly suggest that ischemia and vascular impairment play a central role in the etiology of AMD; 5) Most importantly, zinc deficiency is highly associated with retinal pathologies that are induced by retinal ischemia. There is hoarding evidence, which indicate that zinc deficiency in the retina contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. It has been suggested that replenishing zinc by oral administration had a positive effect on AMD patients by slowing down the progress of the dry form of the disease. These findings support the view that zinc deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of AMD. The 2004 AREDS report and other studies confirm that replacing zinc with a dietary supplement has beneficial effects against AMD. Therefore, the Zn-AMD connection suggests that the risk for or severity of AMD increases with the depletion of available intracellular zinc pools in the retina.Hypoxia inducible factor members have been implicated in regulating the angiogenic and metabolic response to ischemia. HIF-1\u03b1 is known to exist in subretinal NV and hypoxia is the main inducer for the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It has been reported that zinc hampers hypoxia-stimulated HIF-1 activation in astrocytes by inhibiting nuclear HIF-1\u03b1 translocation and subsequently disrupting HIF-1 heterodimerization. Zinc inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 recruitment onto VEGF promoter and the zinc-induced suppression of HIF-1-dependent activation of VEGF. Of note is the finding that zinc also inhibited HIF-2\u03b1 other than HIF-1\u03b1; this is highly relevant in light of the fact that recent studies have shown that HIF-2\u03b1 may be the main regulator of long term (chronic) hypoxic gene expression.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 34024, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that influence the expression of ZnT8 under ischemic conditions; we have utilized the mouse model of OIR. This model has been widely used in studies related to proliferative DR, ROP, and in studies evaluating the efficacy of antiangiogenic compounds. In the retina, hypoxia may occur as a result of vascular disruption caused by various pathologies, such as hyperglycemia in DM, thrombosis in vein occlusions or developmental delays in ROP. Furthermore, hypoxia/ischemia are the key driving force inducing a vascular response, whereby insufficiently perfused tissue is revascularised by the sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels. However, this revascularization condition is sometimes not successful, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels\u2013so-called \u2018neovascularization\u2019. NV is major vision-threatening sequelae in many ischemic retinopathies because of the abnormal vascular leakage, which cause edema and exert tractional forces that untimely cause retinal detachment. It is therefore, tentative to speculate that ischemic vascular disease in the retina may either leave retina permanently ischemic with slow degradation of vision, or alternatively lead to proliferative vascular disease, which can also destroy vision. It has been shown that low concentrations of zinc were neuroprotective in the retina.

A plethora of reports have addressed ischemic retinopathy and the role in which ZnT8 play in DM. However, the link between ZnT8 and ischemic retinopathy has not been defined yet. Our current investigation also highlights the neuroprotective effects of YC-1. Previously, we have reported the pleiortropic effects of YC-1 on various hypoxia/ischemia-induced retinal pathologies. These investigations have concluded that YC-1 targets several antiangiogenic properties in the ischemic retina, via various mechanisms, which were mainly centered on the; (1) suppression the HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels, accumulation, and stability; (2) blocking the HIF-1\u03b1 nuclear shuttling mechanism; (3) promoting the HIF-1\u03b1 proteasomal degradation; (4) inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-2 \u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1), VEGF, erythropoietin (EPO), enodthelin-1 (ET-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at the message and the protein levels. Furthermore, our current sequence analysis of ZnT8 indicates the presence of a hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter region of ZnT8. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 (or possibly HIF-2\u03b1) overexpression notably suppresses ZnT8 expression, whereas the inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 (or possibly HIF-2\u03b1) by YC-1 rescues the injured retina by upregulating the ZnT8 levels. It has been demonstrated that levels of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) were increased after ischemic injury.

It has been demonstrated the antiapoptotic effects of NO are mediated, in part, by cyclic guanosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and downstream target protein kinase G (PKG). Furthermore, it has been reported that nitric oxide (NO) serves as neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems and certain neuronal cells. At low physiological concentrations, NO can act as an antiapoptotic/prosurvival factor in neural cells. It has been revealed that NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway was crucially involved in the learning enhancement of YC-1 and appeared to play an essential role in preventing the activation of a proapoptotic pathway, thus promoting neural cell survival. In addition, in rat astrocytes, YC-1 analogs attenuated H2O2-induced effects, and demonstrated their neuroprotective effects against cellular injury in cortical neurons. The neuroprotective properties of these analogs may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and stroke. However, further studies are necessary to determine the exact mechanism by which YC-1 form confers neuroprotection. In the current study, we show for the first time the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina. Here we show for the first time the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina. The ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the retina exhibited the strongest ZnT8 expression, whereas the PRL, INL and IPL showed moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hypoxic/ischemic insult has mediated a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the message and protein levels, in vitro and in vivo. The ZnT8-depleted cells were primarily localized in the photoreceptor layers/neurosensory retina. Our data also suggest that a treatment with YC-1, a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1, at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M on P12 and P15, rescues the injured retina by restoring the ZnT8 expression to basal homeostatic level, which was comparable to those of the nontreated normoxic retinas. It is noteworthy that although YC-1 inhibition of HIF-1 seems to rescue the ischemia-induced retinal damage, and despite the plethora of published literature available showing the beneficial outcomes of inhibiting HIF-1; several studies have indicated that inhibition of HIF-1 is detrimental during ischemic or hypoxic injury. These studies have demonstrated that during diabetic complications, the cellular response to hypoxia has been shown to be impaired, and hyperglycemia appears to be the critical event implicated in such deregulation, most likely as a result of destabilization of HIF-1. Hence, impairment of the regulation of HIF-1 may have several deleterious consequences for cell and tissue adaptation and survival at low oxygen levels. This apparent anomaly is difficult to reconcile but possibly related to different experimental models. Taken together, this study extends the possible use of YC-1 as a therapeutic agent in through its effect on Zn++ homeostasis. Combined with our in vivo finding; our data raises the possibility that under ischemic conditions, glial cells are the predominant source of ZnT8, and YC-1 may be upregulating ZnT8 expression by acting directly on retinal glial cells. Moreover, our data raise an interesting possibility that glial malfunction may play a crucial role in the molecular mechanism(s), which links DM and ischemic retinopathy through the expression of ZnT-8. Whether the reduced expression of ZnT8 is paralleled by significant changes in Zn++ homeostasis is yet to be determined. This can be revealed through experiments measuring the intracellular Zn++ directly. In addition, ZnT8 knockout animals might prove very useful in addressing this issue. It is however likely, that since the zinc role is intimately linked to AMD, which is an ocular pathology that is manifested during oxygen-induced retinopathy; the possibility exists that reduced ZnT8 expression in our model might be reflected by the significant changes in Zn++ homeostasis due to ischemic insults. Moreover, since ZnT8 is responsible for transporting Zn++ from the cytosol to the intra-cellular vesicles, it is highly possible that reduced ZnT8 expression may lead to the accumulation of Zn++ in the cytosol; hence induce toxicity. This might be supported by the findings of other studies, which demonstrated that in pressure-induced ischemia; zinc has been shown to be toxic and therefore, endogenous zinc may contribute to ischemic neuronal death in the retina.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 42598, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our data have indicated that treatment with YC-1, a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1 reversed the decreased ZnT8 expression levels, in vivo and in vitro.

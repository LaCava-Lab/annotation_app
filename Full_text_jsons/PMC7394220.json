Recent studies showed that aberrant trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) level was associated with cell apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra via histone methyltransferase (HMT) mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) mediated epigenetic pathway. Mouse IS model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mouse primary cortical mixed cells were cultured and treated with oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate IS process. The expressions of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/serine\u2013threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP)/14-3-3 complex, ASK-1/tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) complex, and MLL1 in mouse brain tissue and mouse primary cortical mixed cells were analyzed. The function of MLL1 was investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MLL1 and vector overexpressing MLL1. In vivo inhibition of MLL1 was conducted to explore its value as a therapeutic target. The prognostic value of MLL1 was investigated in IS patients. Results showed that the expressions of ASK-1, pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/TNF-\u03b1 complex, and MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra compared to brain tissue from the control group (P < 0.05). MCAO and OGD significantly upregulated the H3K4me3 level in ASK-1 promoter region and promoted the recruitment of MLL1 to this region (P < 0.05). siMLL1 significantly reversed the proapoptosis effects of OGD in primary cortical mixed cells, while MLL1 overexpression induced apoptosis of cells (P < 0.05). In vivo inhibition of MLL1 significantly reduced the infarct volume and the neurological score of MCAO mice (P < 0.05). Serum MLL1 level had a positive association with that in ischemic core and penumbra in mouse model and was positively correlated with the infarct volume and neurological score (P < 0.05). Besides, serum MLL1 level was also significantly correlated with the severity of IS (P < 0.05), and high serum MLL1 level indicated poor prognosis of IS patients (P < 0.05). These results revealed that MLL1 contributed to neuron cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbra after IS onset by promoting the formation of ASK-1/TNF-\u03b1 complex, and its serum level was associated with poor prognosis of IS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2578, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 2591, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke, accounting for ~80% of all strokes (Adeoye et al.,).

To prevent TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis, serine\u2013threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) and 14-3-3 proteins interact with ASK-1 to disrupt associations between TNF receptor-associated factor 2 and ASK-1 upon TNF-\u03b1 stimulation (Hatai et al.,; Han et al.,). In recent years, the aberrant histone methylation was suggested to be associated with neuron cell apoptosis (Zhoa et al.,; Yung et al.,). Histone methylation can promote or inhibit the transcription of methylation sites, and lysine (K) methylation of histone is a research hotspot in recent years (Alam et al.,; Kim et al.,). As an active histone modification, the trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) can be recognized by specific proteins and further recruit downstream coregulatory components, thus promoting the transcription and expression of the target genes (Bochy\u0144ska et al.,).

IS can be caused by brain ischemia. The blockage of a brain artery accounts for ~80% of the IS cases (Adeoye et al.,). In the process of IS development, the cerebral tissue has two important and independent areas: the core of the infarct and the ischemic penumbra. The core of the infarct is defined as the severe hypoperfusion area where neurons directly affected by the lack of glucose and oxygen, and eventually die by necrosis, while the ischemic penumbra is the less hypoperfused area surrounding the core, where neuronal cells are still metabolically active within a certain period and\u2014depending on circumstances\u2014will either die or survive (Berta et al.,). Cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra may occur in hours or days, and this process is multifactorial and complex (Radak et al.,). Presently, local recanalization and systemic thrombolysis are the only therapeutic options to treat IS, with a short therapeutic window for 4.5 h after stroke onset, and only 20% of patients benefit from this treatment (Chamorro et al.,).

We found that MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra after IS onset, and the upregulated MLL1 was recruited to the promoter region of ASK-1 to catalyze H3K4me3 in this region and further promoted the expression of ASK-1 and enhanced the activation of ASK-1/TNF-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis. ASK-1 is a cytosolic protein, and TNF-\u03b1 is an extracellular protein; these two proteins interacted indirectly based on their interactions with the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1; Han et al.,). TNFR1 is a transmembrane molecule. After the initiation of TNFR1, the TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein is shuttled from TNFR1 to the cytoplasm and then interacts with the Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) protein and caspase to generate apoptosis complex to amplify TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis (Micheau and J\u00fcrg,). MM102, a small-molecule inhibitor, was further used to investigate the function of MLL1. We built an in vitro model to estimate whether MM102 could cross the BBB. In vitro BBB models have been in use for decades and have been of great benefit in the process of investigating and understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BBB establishment. However, there are still some differences between the in vitro model of BBB and the in vivo one (Czupalla et al.,). First, BMECs are known to dedifferentiate in vitro, and the characteristics of BMECs will gradually disappear with the extension of culture time; then, the function of these cells will be affected. Second, the in vivo BBB is composed of BMECs, astrocytes, and pericytes; however, the in vitro model we used in this study only consists of BMECs and astrocytes and that may cripple the barrier function of BBB. Third, the in vitro BBB models always rely on Transwell chambers for functional measurements, while BMECs behave differently according to their growth surface, so the different cultural materials may lead to different results. Due to these defects, the results should be explained cautiously. In our study, results of the in vitro study showed that MM102 could cross the BBB, and in vivo inhibition of MLL1 alleviated neurological damage caused by IS; these both suggest that MM102 is an effective molecule for IS treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 34818, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Additionally, we observed that serum MLL1 level was positively correlated with that in ischemic penumbra from MCAO mouse, indicating the feasibility to detect MLL1 by minimally invasive means.

MLL1 mRNA in the serum might also be from the damaged vessels, blood cells, and/or cells in other organs affected by the systemic inflammatory response (Anrather and Costantino,). What is more, we found that MLL1 expression showed a rapid increase within the primary 2 h after IS onset and remained a stable level within 2\u201348 h.

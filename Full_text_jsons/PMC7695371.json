We coupled 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship-based virtual profiling with phenotypic analysis using 3D tumorsphere formation as a gold standard for assessing the presence of CSC. Among the top 20 computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics, four fulfilled the phenotypic endpoint of specifically suppressing the tumorsphere-initiating capacity of CSC, in the absence of significant cytotoxicity against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D cultures in the same low micromolar concentration range. Of these, 3,4-dihydrophenetyl butyrate \u2013a lipophilic ester conjugate of the hydroxytyrosol moiety of oleacein\u2013 and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide) \u2013an inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi triosephosphate isomerase\u2013 were also highly effective at significantly reducing the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like proliferating cells.

Using a holistic approach for phenotypic drug discovery coupled with mechanism-of-action functional profiling and target deconvolution, we recently identified the dihydroxy-phenol oleacein (the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol) as a metabolo-epigenetic inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).

However, a recent delineation of the high-level functions of oleacein in terms of biomolecular interactions, signaling pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks revealed that the so-called oleacein target landscape likely involved more than 700 proteins rather than solely mTOR and DNMTs. Thus, although the ability of oleacein to operate as a multi-faceted regulator of numerous metabolic processes and chromatin-modifying enzymatic activities might open new horizons for CSC-targeted therapy based on the molecular bridge that connects metabolism and epigenetics with the aberrant state of stemness in cancer tissues, a biomimicry design process of oleacein mimetics remains a highly challenging task.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 3661, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we used a natural-product-inspired drug discovery approach to identify new small molecules capable of phenotypically mimicking the anti-CSC actions of oleacein.

But, the presence of more aromatic rings in the oleacein molecule resulted in a slightly different binding strength from that of PP242 and Torin 2. Similarly, the presence of aromatic rings notably influenced the binding of the selected oleacein mimetics to mTOR (Figure 2). In fact, we predicted three different binding modes, one of them involving 5 oleacein mimetics that apparently shared the originally described binding mode of parental oleacein; and another two models encompassing 13 compounds and 2 compounds showing a binding mode closely resembling that of TORKinhibs (Figure 2).

First, the somewhat structurally complex framework of the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (i.e., oleacein) was computationally captured in terms of molecules with oleacein-like physico-chemical profiles. Second, we in silico compared the binding modes of the top 20 computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics to the two molecular targets originally involved in the capacity of oleacein to specifically suppress the functional traits of tumor-initiating CSC (i.e., mTOR and DNMT). Third, we phenotypically explored the computationally-discovered oleacein biomimetics in terms of their anti-CSC activity. Fourth, we evaluated the structure-mTOR/DNMT bioactivity relationship of the most promising oleacein-mimetic candidates. By doing so, four oleacein mimetics, namely N\u2019-[4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane-1,3-diamine, (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, N-(4-nitrobenzyl)ethenesulfonamide, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate (a.k.a. hydroxytyrosol butyrate), fulfilled the first phenotypic endpoint of the selection criteria, which was the specific suppression of the 3D mammosphere forming capability of CSC in the low micromolar range without highly significant cytotoxic effects against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D cultures in the same range of concentrations. Moreover, non-cytotoxic concentrations of the oleacein mimetics hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide efficiently suppressed the population of ALDH1+ epithelial-like proliferating CSC, a second phenotypic endpoint of the selection criteria for anti-CSC candidates.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 21359, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The fact that the oleacein mimetics-responsive phenotypes were exclusively manifested under 3D stem cell culture conditions along with their capacity to specifically and potently suppress (>90%) ALDH1+ CSC-like cellular states irrespective of the mutational landscape of the cancer cell population strongly suggested that their mechanism of action targets the biological functioning of cancer stemness per se. Hydroxytyrosol butyrate is a chemically-modified (alkyl ester) lipophilic version of hydroxytyrosol that is more stable than parental hydroxytyrosol under biological conditions. The fact that the inclusion of a short-medium lipophilic chain in the hydroxytyrosol molecule sufficed to recapitulate, at least in part, both the anti-CSC behavior and the anti-mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity of the parental oleacein highlights the functional relevance of the dihydroxybenzene moiety within the phenolic part of oleacein, a scaffold that seems to be a crucial mediator of the metabolo-epigenetic modulatory effects of oleacein (e.g., COMT, IDH1, LSD1) via formation of stacking interactions, coordination with metal ions, and/or establishment of hydrophobic and/or hydrogen bond interactions through the hydroxyl groups or the aromatic ring (Figure 6C). The second oleacein scaffold, which comprises the secoiridoid dialdehyde part, might be involved in the stabilization of oleacein via hydrophobic interactions within the binding pocket of the targeted proteins. Accordingly, although hydroxytyrosol butyrate preserved the original double occupancy of oleacein within the catalytic sites of mTOR and DNMT, the sole dihydroxybenzene moiety does not suffice to fully preserve the low-micromolar biological activity of oleacein against mTOR and DNMT enzymatic activities. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, originally described as an inhibitor of the Trypanosoma cruzi triosephosphate isomerase, lacked the original binding sites of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT, thereby fully losing the original ability of oleacein to operate as a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitor. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, however, appeared to operate as an optimized mimetic of oleacein capable of exhibiting a very promising and potent activity against ALDH1-positive breast CSC. These findings can be consistent with the notion that preservation of the original binding mode of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT is an obligatory requirement for a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity of hydroxytyrosol-related oleacein mimetics (e.g., hydroxytyrosol butyrate) with anti-CSC activity; for hydroxytyrosol-unrelated oleacein mimetics (e.g., (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), however, the absence of a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity is dispensable for an efficient suppression of the ALDH+-CSC functional phenotype.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 24243, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that the pharma-nutritional properties of oleacein that elicit its functioning as an anti-CSC compound can be phenocopied through the use of mimetics that capture its physico-chemical properties.

However, their rapid non-genomic effects and underlying mechanisms on neural activities remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the rapid non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.2 channels in cultured HEK293\u00a0cells and acute brain slices including cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses in the brain stem. We found that cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, rapidly increased Kv2.2 currents by increasing the single-channel open probability in Kv2.2-expressing HEK293\u00a0cells through activation of the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor. Bovine serum albumin-conjugated dexamethasone, a membrane-impermeable agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, could mimic the effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 channels. The cortisol-increased Kv2.2 currents were induced by activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinase, which could be inhibited by U0126, an antagonist of the ERK signaling pathway. In layer 2 cortical pyramidal neurons and the calyx of Held synapses, cortisol suppressed the action potential firing frequency during depolarization and reduced the successful rate upon high-frequency stimulation by activating Kv2.2 channels. We further examined the postsynaptic responses and found that cortisol did not affect the mEPSC and evoked EPSC, but increased the activity-dependent synaptic depression induced by a high-frequency stimulus train. In conclusion, glucocorticoids can rapidly activate Kv2.2 channels through membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suppress presynaptic action potential firing, and inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity. This may be a universal mechanism of the glucocorticoid-induced non-genomic effects in the central nervous system.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2028, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2041, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rats and mice, are produced by the zona fasciculata cells of the adrenal cortex in a diurnal pattern under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, immune function, and the response to stress. They have been widely acknowledged as stress hormones, and their production markedly increases following exposure to stress. In the mammalian brain, stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoids induce variable neuronal effects via both genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways. The genomic pathway, which has been well studied, is mainly mediated by the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. Activated by glucocorticoid binding, the glucocorticoid receptors undergo conformational changes and translocate to the nucleus to regulate cellular gene expression. For example, stress-induced increases in the glucocorticoid level induce neuronal structure changes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. However, the non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids, which usually occur within a few minutes and depend on the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor, are still not fully understood.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3282, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Increasing evidence indicates that the rapid non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids may be related to the ion channels on the cell membrane.

Moreover, in the presence of corticosterone, additional treatment with cortisol did not further increase the IK currents (Fig. 3B), indicating that the effects of cortisone and cortisol on the potassium channel currents are mediated through the same signaling pathway. To determine whether the cortisol-increased IK in the pyramidal neurons was mediated by Kv2.2 channels, we selectively inhibited the Kv2.2 channels via intracellular application of Kv2.2-specific antibody in the pipette solution using a whole-cell configuration. Approximately 1\u20132\u00a0min after break-in, Kv2.2-specific antibody dramatically reduced the IK by 51.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9% (Ctrl: 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nA; Anti-Kv2.2: 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0nA; n\u00a0=\u00a05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), and additional application of 10\u00a0\u03bcM cortisol to the extracellular solution for 5\u00a0min could no longer increase the IK (88.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.8% compared to the IK with Kv2.2 antibody; n\u00a0=\u00a05; p\u00a0=\u00a00.4311, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), confirming that Kv2.2 plays a dominant role in mediating the cortisol-induced increase in the potassium current in cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons. To further confirm the involvement of Kv2.2 channels in the cortisol-induced increase of IK, we used lentivirus vectors to deliver shRNA targeted to affect post-translational silencing of the Kv2.2 gene in the pyramidal neurons. First, the knockdown efficiency of the shRNA was tested in HEK293\u00a0cells overexpressing Kv2.2 (KD-Kv2.2: 39.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5%; n\u00a0=\u00a03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, left). The shRNA targeting Kv2.2 channels reduced IK by 62.3% in the pyramidal neurons (Scramble: 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nA; n\u00a0=\u00a04; KD-Kv2.2: 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nA; n\u00a0=\u00a06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0016, unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, right). The knockdown of Kv2.2 channels mimicked Kv2.2 antibody-induced inhibition of the cortisol-induced increase in Kv2.2 currents (KD-Kv2.2: 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0nA; n\u00a0=\u00a06; KD-Kv2.2\u00a0+\u00a0cortisol: 1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0nA; n\u00a0=\u00a06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.7077, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3E). Similar to our observations in HEK293\u00a0cells above, RU486 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) or U0126 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) abolished the cortisol-induced increase in IK in the cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor and ERK1/2 signaling pathway, respectively (RU486\u00a0+\u00a0cortisol compared to the IK with RU486: 104.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4%; n\u00a0=\u00a08; p\u00a0=\u00a00.1212, paired Student's t-test; U0126\u00a0+\u00a0cortisol compared to the IK with U0126: 96.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6%; n\u00a0=\u00a08; p\u00a0=\u00a00.1471, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3F and G).

However, there are few reports on glucocorticoid's rapid effect (within minutes) on ion channels. A previous study reported that cortisol rapidly inhibits Kv1.5 current in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, the downstream signaling pathway of the glucocorticoid-induced rapid effect on ion channels remains elusive. Ffrench-Mullen reported that cortisol rapidly inhibits L-type calcium channels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons via the PKC signaling pathway. Previous studies have suggested that the specific kinase pathways involved in mediating the rapid effects of glucocorticoids can vary depending on the cellular context. For example, in the hippocampus, glucocorticoids have been found to enhance CA1 pyramidal excitability through activation of ERK1/2 kinase, whereas in the hypothalamus, they have been shown to inhibit glutamatergic synaptic activity of PVN parvocellular neurons through activation of the PKC pathway. In human bronchial epithelial cells, dexamethasone has been shown to decrease intracellular Ca2+ by activating PKA, whereas in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, dexamethasone has been reported to increase intracellular Ca2+ by deactivating ERK1/2 kinase.

After binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, glucocorticoids could further modulate the activities of various kinases, including PKA, PKC, and ERK. Previous studies have shown that dexamethasone rapidly (within 5\u00a0min) decreases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in human leukemia cell lines Nalm-6 and Reh and that BSA-conjugated corticosterone rapidly (within 15\u00a0min) inhibits the NMDA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured hippocampal neurons.

The Kv2.1 channel has been reported to be widely expressed in the brain. However, previous studies have shown that the Kv2.2 channels were preferentially expressed in layer 2 pyramidal neurons, the basal forebrain, and the MNTB neurons. Kv2 channels are high voltage-activated (HVA) channels with slow activation kinetics and, therefore, contribute little to the resting membrane potential and single AP properties. Consistent with this, we found that cortisol did not change the resting membrane potentials and single AP properties in layer 2 pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses in the MNTB (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The effect of Kv2 on neuronal activity can be excitatory or inhibitory. Kv2 channels have been shown to facilitate repetitive AP firing by promoting recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivation. Inhibition of Kv2 channels could reduce the repetitive firing in MNTB neurons while increasing the fidelity of repetitive firing in dorsal root ganglia neurons. In previous studies, dexamethasone rapidly increased basal nitric oxide production in human endothelial cells and enhanced ATP-induced nitric oxide production in spiral ganglion neurons. Steinert et al. reported that the potentiation of Kv2 currents by nitric oxide reduces the excitability of MNTB and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons, indicating a potential role of nitric oxide in the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on neuronal Kv2.2. Interestingly, in the present study, we found that either inhibition of Kv2.2 with antibodies or activation of Kv2.2 by cortisol reduced the firing rate in the pyramidal cortical neurons and presynaptic nerve terminals at the calyx of Held synapses (Fig. 6E\u2013H), suggesting that Kv2.2 plays a key role in fine-tuning the repetitive neuronal firing upon stimulation. Moreover, we observed that cortisol could strongly enhance synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation. At calyces, the presynaptic AP firing rate can be 50\u00a0Hz in the resting condition and increase to more than 600\u00a0Hz upon stimulation.

Previous studies suggested that glucocorticoid receptors in the prefrontal cortex were involved in the negative feedback regulation of stress-induced HPA activation. The projection of the prefrontal cortex to PVN neuroendocrine cells is through local interneurons, majority of which are GABAergic. Therefore, the inhibitory glucocorticoid action in cortical neurons may be expected to produce fast activation of the HPA axis.

In addition, frontal cortex stimulation has been shown to stimulate corticosterone secretion in rats, and local application of glucocorticoids in the medial frontal cortex inhibits stress-induced HPA activation, suggesting that the rapid inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on the actions of prefrontal cortical neurons may provide fast negative feedback regulation of stress-induced HPA activation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 63744, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Under non-stress conditions, glucocorticoids are secreted in pulsatile patterns following circadian rhythms, with concentration ranging from tens to hundreds of nanomolars in both rats and mice.

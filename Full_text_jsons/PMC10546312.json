The aim of our study has been to develop and manufacture a CAR-T cell product that addresses some of the current limitations. We initially compared the phenotype of T cells from AML patients and healthy young and elderly controls. This analysis showed that T cells from AML patients displayed a predominantly effector phenotype, with increased expression of activation (CD69 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion markers (PD1 and LAG3), in contrast to the enriched memory phenotype observed in healthy donors. This differentiated and more exhausted phenotype was also observed, and corroborated by transcriptomic analyses, in CAR-T cells from AML patients engineered with an optimized CAR construct targeting CD33, resulting in a decreased in vivo antitumoral efficacy evaluated in xenograft AML models. To overcome some of these limitations we have combined CRISPR-based genome editing technologies with virus-free gene-transfer strategies using Sleeping Beauty transposons, to generate CAR-T cells depleted of HLA-I and TCR complexes (HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells) for allogeneic approaches. Our optimized protocol allows one-step generation of edited CAR-T cells that show a similar phenotypic profile to non-edited CAR-T cells, with equivalent in vitro and in vivo antitumoral efficacy. Moreover, genomic analysis of edited CAR-T cells revealed a safe integration profile of the vector, with no preferences for specific genomic regions, with highly specific editing of the HLA-I and TCR, without significant off-target sites. Finally, the production of edited CAR-T cells at a larger scale allowed the generation and selection of enough HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells that would be compatible with clinical applications. In summary, our results demonstrate that CAR-T cells from AML patients, although functional, present phenotypic and functional features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors. The combination of CRISPR technologies with transposon-based delivery strategies allows the generation of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells, compatible with allogeneic approaches, that would represent a promising option for AML treatment.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2477, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2490, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Adoptive immunotherapy using T cells engineered with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR-T cells) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for several B cell malignancies. The impressive results with CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and BCMA have led to the approval by the FDA and the EMA of several CAR-T cell products for refractory cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the use of CAR-T cell therapy for other hematological malignancies, and in particular for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), still presents specific challenges that hamper their efficacy and limit their implementation. One of the main biological barriers for CAR-T therapies in AML is the absence of AML-specific antigens. Most of the cell surface antigens present in AML blasts (CD33, CD123, or CLL1) are also present in normal hematopoietic, representing a safety concern, since a prolonged myeloablation would be ultimately fatal. Thus, several strategies to prevent the risk of bone marrow failure after CAR-T therapy have been proposed, including the limitation of CAR-T cell persistence, by the inclusion of safety switches, or the identification of neoantigens specific for AML blasts. Another interesting approach, currently under clinical evaluation, is the generation of leukemia-specific antigen by deleting CD33 from normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, thereby enabling specific targeting of AML with CD33-CAR-T cells, since hematopoietic system would be resistant to CD33-targeted therapy. Nevertheless, most of the current CAR-T therapies under clinical evaluation are directed against CD33 or CD123, reporting antitumoral responses in some cases, although more complete clinical results have yet to be published. In addition, the dependency on patient-specific T cells for autologous approaches, particularly from heavily treated patients, may lead to inadequate T cell numbers, suboptimal CAR-T cell functions, and unsuccessful CAR-T cell production. However, there is a lack of studies performing a detailed and deep characterization of AML patient-derived CAR-T cells with a direct comparison to CAR-T cells from healthy donors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4660, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The use of allogeneic CAR-T cells could overcome some of the limitations of autologous patient-specific CAR-T cells. However, allogeneic cells may trigger graft-versus- host disease (GvHD) that would compromise therapeutic safety. Since TCR ablation prevents GvHD, several strategies for endogenous TCR inactivation in CAR-T cells have been reported. One of the most promising approaches relies on the use of TALEN and/or CRISPR technologies for TCR disruption, which can be combined with different viral and non-viral vectors for the generation of allogeneic CAR-T cells. Despite allogeneic CAR-T cells can be successfully manufactured for therapeutic applications, there is an unmet need to overcome several limitations related to complex manufacturing procedures or the use of viral vectors, that would allow a cost-effective and safer generation of allogeneic CAR-T cell products. In this sense, the use of non-viral vectors based on Sleeping Beauty transposon systems for CAR delivery has emerged as a promising option that offers a number of advantages, including larger cargo capacity, reduced manufacturing complexity and costs, and safer integration profiles compared with integrating viral vectors.

To determine whether differences in phenotype and activation may play a role in the functionality of CAR-T cells, using our selected CAR construct, we generated CAR-T cells (CD33-CAR-T) from AML patients that were compared to CD33-CAR-T cells from young (adult) and elderly (senior) healthy donors ( Table S5 ). Non-transduced T cells (UTD) from each group were used as controls. The proliferation capacity of the CD33-CAR-T and UTD cells from the different groups was similar, reaching 4-5 population doublings during the expansion phase. Moreover, similar transduction efficiency was observed between the different groups, with around 50% of CAR+ cells, suggesting that transduction was not impaired in AML T cells ( Figures\u00a02A, B ). Phenotypic analysis revealed that CD33-CAR-T cells from both senior donors and AML patients presented a statistically significant reduced percentage of memory stem (TSCM) and central memory T cells (TCM), with increased levels of activation markers like CD69 and HLA-DR. However, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented an increased proportion of terminal effector (TE) T cells, with higher levels of PD1 and LAG3 exhaustion markers ( Figures\u00a02C, D ,  S3 ). Altogether, these data suggest that the initial T cell phenotype has a clear impact on the final phenotypic features of the CAR-T cells, with significant differences in the differentiation, activation, and exhaustion states produced by both age-related and AML-specific factors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23376, "infons": {"file": "fimmu-14-1270843-g001.jpg", "id": "f1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Phenotypic characterization of T cells from AML patients.

Regardless of their origin, all CD33-CAR-T cells were highly cytotoxic, producing similar levels of IFN-\u03b3 ( Figures\u00a03A, B ,  S4 ). To further explore CAR-T cell functionality under more challenging conditions, a continuous repeated in vitro stimulation for 21 days with tumoral cells was performed. Under these conditions, we found that CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented a more exhausted phenotype, with increased PD1 and LAG3 expression, and a decreased proliferation potential that was statistically significant ( Figures\u00a03C, D ,  S4 ). These features were also associated with reduced cytotoxic capacity after repeated restimulations ( Figure\u00a03E ). The antitumoral potential of the CAR-T cells was then evaluated in vivo in a xenograft model of NSG mice transplanted with MOLM-13 cells, as described above. Treatment with all CD33-CAR-T cells significantly increased animal survival compared to UTD controls with no differences between male and female animals ( Figure S4 ). Interestingly, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients showed a statistically significant reduction of the antitumor activity with reduced survival compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors (adult and senior) ( Figure\u00a03F ). To address whether the decreased capacity of CD33-CAR-T from AML patients could be reverted by modifying the design on the CAR construct, we replaced 4-1BB sequence by CD28 costimulatory domain and compared CD33-CAR-T cells generated from AML patients using both constructs. Similar transduction efficiency and proliferation potential were observed between 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells, with no differences in the phenotypic subpopulations, activation/exhaustion markers, cytotoxic capacity, or IFN-\u03b3 production after coculture with tumoral cells ( Figure S5 ). Finally, both 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells presented similar antitumoral efficacy in vivo in the xenograft model in NSG mice ( Figure S5 ).

RNAseq analysis before antigen recognition revealed that CAR-T cells from AML patients were transcriptionally similar to those from senior healthy donors, with only a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an FDR<0.05 and a |log2FC|>1 (31 for CD4+ and 12 for CD8+ CAR-T cells) ( Table S6 ). In contrast, most of the differences were observed when CAR-T cells from senior healthy donors and AML patients were compared to CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors (752 and 853 DEGs in CD4+ and 807 and 705 in CD8+ CAR-T cells respectively) ( Figure S6A ). All these differences were reflected in a principal components analysis where CAR-T cells from AML patients clustered together and close to those from senior healthy donors, being separated from CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors in both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cell subsets ( Figure\u00a04A ). A closer analysis of the DEGs revealed that most of the differences observed with adult CAR-T cells were shared between senior and AML CAR-T cells, clearly indicating age-related differences. Thus, CAR-T cells from AML patients and senior healthy donors were enriched in genes related to activation, such as CIITA, with downregulation of genes associated with stem cell memory, like CD28 ( Figure\u00a04B ,  S6D ). Moreover, gene ontology (GO) analysis of common DEGs showed enrichment in pathways related to the regulation of lymphocyte and T cell differentiation ( Figure S6C ), which would explain the more differentiated phenotype observed in the subpopulation analysis. Interestingly, we observed that about 30-40% of the DEGs between AML and adult CAR-T cells were unique to AML condition, indicating specific differences intrinsic to AML. We observed increased expression of genes related to lymphocyte exhaustion, such as LAG3 and NR4A1. Moreover, important genes related to T cell memory (BATF3, CCR7), T cell differentiation (GATA3), apoptosis (BAX, BCL family), or IFN response (OAS1) were also deregulated ( Figure\u00a04C ,  S6E ). In accordance, GO analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to lymphocyte activation, response to stress and DNA damage, regulation of the immune response, antigen receptor-mediated signaling, and regulation of the cell cycle ( Figure S6C ). We further characterized CAR-T cells from AML patients upon stimulation with tumoral cells. Two weeks after stimulation we observed a set of genes presenting disrupted expression patterns (different behavior after stimulation) compared to adult and senior CAR-T cells ( Figures\u00a04D ,  S6F ). Those genes were related to CAR-T cell migration and cell adhesion (CD81, CCL5, MMP25), proliferation (IRF1, CCR7), or regulation of cytokine production (KLF2, IL32), which would explain the reduced proliferation potential and antitumoral efficacy of these AML CAR-T cells.

To prevent the immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) associated with allogeneic cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout HLA-I and TCR expression. First, we designed different single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and exon 1 of T-cell receptor \u03b1 constant (TRAC) locus, and we selected three sgRNAs based on their location and the predicted on-target/off-target efficiency ( Table S3 ). Cleavage efficiency was evaluated in vitro by TIDE after transfection of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) in the Jurkat cell line. \u03b22M-sgRNA3 and TRAC-sgRNA2 were selected for further studies since they presented the highest cleavage efficacy, inducing frameshift mutations (mostly 1nt insertions) that resulted in the reduction of HLA-I and TCR levels ( Figure S7 ). Then, selected CRISPR RNPs were combined with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system to generate HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T (CAR-TKO) cells from healthy donors. The transposon vector containing the selected CD33 targeting CAR construct was used as minicircle (MC) and the SB100X transposase was provided as mRNA. Our optimized protocol allowed in a single electroporation an efficient depletion of HLA-I and TCR complexes, with more than 69% of double negative cells, and an efficient CAR delivery, that was slightly reduced when CAR and RNP were delivered together (average of 46.8% vs 32.4%) ( Figures\u00a05A, B ,  S8 ). Genome-edited CD33-CAR-T cells were further purified using magnetic beads which yielded >98% double-negative cells while maintaining the percentage of transduction (CAR+ cells) ( Figures\u00a05C, D ,  S8 ). The proliferation capacity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells, although not significant, was slightly reduced compared to non-edited CAR-T cells, an effect that was also observed in UTDKO cells, consistent with the effect of electroporation ( Figure\u00a05E ). Moreover, no differences were observed in terms of CD4/CD8 ratio, population subsets, or the expression of activation and exhaustion markers ( Figures\u00a05F, G ,  S9 ), indicating that HLA-I and TCR depletion did not affect CAR-T cell phenotype. Then in vitro cytotoxicity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells against MOLM-13 cells was equivalent to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure\u00a05H ). Moreover, although proliferation was slightly reduced after continuous restimulation with tumoral cells, CD33-CAR-TKO cells also presented similar cytotoxic activity to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure S9 ). Finally, although the in vivo antitumoral potential in a xenograft model in NSG mice was slightly reduced compared to previous results, where some total remissions were observed, no differences were observed between CD33-CAR-TKO and CD33-CAR-T cells ( Figures\u00a05I ,  S9 ).

Moreover, integration site analysis revealed a safe integration profile of the CAR, with no differences due to CRISPR modifications. We mapped and characterized a total of 94148 unique insertion sites of three independent CD33-CAR-TKO and CAR-T cell productions. Most of the insertions were located at the expected AT-rich DNA regions of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, detecting the palindromic ATATATAT motif, which contains the TA dinucleotide target sequence adjacent to all the insertions ( Figure S10 ). Moreover, CAR insertions presented a wide distribution within the genome, with no preferences for promoter or exonic regions, and most of the insertions were located at distal intergenic regions ( Figures\u00a06B ,  S10 ). An additional potential issue associated with CRISPR-based genome editing would be the genotoxicity due to non-specific cleavage of the genome.

However, similar results have not been obtained in other hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite one of the main barriers hampering CAR-T cell efficacy in AML is the absence of AML-specific antigens, since most of the cell surface antigens present in AML blasts are also present in normal hematopoietic cells, for this work we selected CD33 as a model antigen for several reasons. CD33-CAR-T cells have shown some clinical efficacy, although mature clinical results have yet to be published, and Gemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, is already approved for the treatment of AML patients, supporting their role as an AML target. Moreover, allogeneic CD33-CAR-T cells have a promising therapeutic potential as a bridging therapy, prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for some R/R AML patients. In this study, we addressed several strategies that may contribute to increasing the efficacy of CAR-T cells in AML. First have demonstrated that modifications of different CAR moieties impact the CAR-T cell response. As described for other CAR constructs hinge length and scFv sequence affected CAR activation and tonic signaling, pointing out that optimal configurations are required for efficient recognition. Although this optimization cannot be generalized and should be evaluated for each antigen, we observed that CAR constructs derived from the my96 clone had better antigen-dependent responses probably due to the increased affinity for CD33. The hinge length had a less critical role, but results suggested that shorter versions presented better outcomes, although more experiments should be performed to clarify this point. Other modifications such as changes in the costimulatory domain barely affected CAR-T functionality, especially in vivo, where similar antitumoral efficacy was observed between 4-1BB and CD28 CD33-CAR-T cells using NSG xenograft models. Differences in efficacy associated with co-stimulatory molecules have been described, in part related to activation of different signaling transduction pathways. The reasons for the absence of differences in our case might be explained in part by the aggressivity of the AML model, since a few thousand MOLM-13 cells are able to induce animal death in 2 weeks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 45810, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although several studies have consistently indicated that the fitness of T cells is compromised in patients with AML, our study contributes to understanding some of the regulatory mechanisms underlying these abnormalities. Furthermore, it provides additional evidence that the fitness of the T cells has an impact on the phenotype and functional capacity of the CAR-T cells generated from those T cells. Beyond the impact that CAR-T cell manufacturing has on CAR-T cell phenotype, being more evident in senior samples, differences observed in T cells from AML patients were also translated into the CAR-T cells, presenting an even more differentiated, activated, and exhausted phenotypes, that resulted in a reduced antitumoral efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we identified changes that were age-related, since they were also observed in CAR-T cells from aged-matched healthy donors, which were more exacerbated after tumor recognition in AML CAR-T cells. Other differences, however, were intrinsic to AML, in particular the higher proportion of terminally differentiated effector CD8+ CAR-T cells with increased levels of exhaustion markers. These results are in accordance with studies performed in CAR-T cells from MM patients, another hematological disease mostly developed in elderly people. These features would explain the differences observed in the functionality of those AML CAR-T cells and would suggest that autologous CAR-T cell approaches could not be the best option for AML treatment.

The use of fitter T-cells, the potential to generate many different dosages from a single donor and with significant reduction in costs need to be balanced with the limitations associated with allogeneic cells such as the development of GVHD and the need for additional immunosuppression to facilitate engraftment. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the possibility of manufacturing gene-edited CAR-T cells for the treatment of patients with MM or ALL. Different technologies, including TALEN nucleases or CRISPR systems, have been explored to prevent immune rejection and GvHD, generally by eliminating the expression of endogenous TCR and HLA-I complexes. Editing of additional genes (i.e. PD1, CD52, HLA-II, etc\u2026) would represent a promising option to improve allogeneic CAR-T therapies, by increasing antitumoral efficacy (PD1 disruption) and/or increasing CAR-T cell persistence (CD52 knock-out). Moreover, the use of novel gene editing technologies, such as base-editing tools, would represent a promising and safer option under evaluation for the generation of allogeneic CAR-T cells. However, the large-scale production compatible with clinical applications, as well as the clinical efficacy and safety of these multiple-gene edited CAR-T cells still needs to be demonstrated.

In contrast to recently published protocols, where the CAR transduction and editing steps are performed sequentially, our protocol uses a single electroporation step for the efficient delivery of the CAR and the efficient depletion of both HLA-I and TCR complexes. Although the transduction efficiency is slightly reduced in the edited cell, with a lower number of CAR+ cells our protocol is able to generate enough cells compatible with clinical applications. In accordance with previous studies, we have also demonstrated that double HLA-I and TCR-depleted CAR-T cells (CAR-TKO cells) have similar features to non-edited CAR-T cells. Moreover, although some variabilities were observed in the in vivo antitumoral efficacy, probably due to the aggressivity of the tumor model and the donor\u2019s variability, CAR-TKO cells are fully functional. In summary, although additional studies related to CAR-TKO cell persistence could be performed to better characterize this aspect in long-term applications, our results would support the use of these CAR-TKO cells for therapeutic approaches in R/R AML patients where CAR-T cells are used to reduce tumor burden as bridging therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 50535, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We have additionally performed a set of analyses to confirm the safety of CAR-TKO cells. The combination of the SB transposon system with CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) does not alter either the vector copy number or the insertion site, indicating that CAR-TKO cells maintain the safe integration profile described for SB transposon system. Moreover, off-target analysis using improved technologies for unbiased genome-wide analysis, corroborated that CRISPR-mediated modifications were specific without significant off-targets. Although the absence of off-targets was expected for the sgRNA targeting the TRAC locus, since it was already described and validated in the literature, the b2M sgRNA was specifically designed for this study, and safety assessment was a requirement for potential clinical translation. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of these two sgRNAs are very efficient and specific. Moreover, based on previous results using the same or similar sgRNAs, we could anticipate that safety issues related to chromosomal rearrangements would be unlikely. In the future, and in order to move to clinical application additional analysis, like CAST-seq, should be performed to corroborate genomic safety. Finally, we have demonstrated that our protocol is scalable, being able to produce sufficient CAR-TKO cells compatible with clinical applications without compromising CAR-T functionality and purity. Moreover, our protocol for the generation of CAR-TKO cells is not restricted to CD33-targeting CAR-T cells, since delivery of the CAR construct and the HLA-I and TCR knock-out processes, although performed together, are independent processes. Thus, HLA-I and TCR disruption (or even other genes of interest) could be combined with any other CAR construct targeting a different antigen, either for AML treatment (i.e. CLL1 or CD44v6) or another relevant disease (i.e. solid tumors). Although currently CAR-T cell manufacturing has a tendency toward the automatization of procedures, as described recently, our approach reduces the number of steps required for production. Moreover, the expansion of the cells in G-Rex devices is compatible with further automatizations in the fill and finish steps, which should be optimized using GMP procedures.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 52810, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In summary, our work demonstrates that CAR-T cells from AML patients, although functional, present phenotypic and functional features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors.

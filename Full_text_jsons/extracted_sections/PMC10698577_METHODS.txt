Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were purchased from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Science. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution (all from Gibco). As previously reported, plasmids for rat Kv2.1 (NM_013186.1) and Kv2.2 (NM_054000.2) channels in pEGFPN1 vectors were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using jetPRIME (Polyplus). For patch clamp recordings, the cells were used after 24 h transfection. Animal and slice preparation Brain slices containing the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were prepared from C57/BL mice of either sex from postnatal week 3. Mice were anesthetized using pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and decapitated. The whole brain was transferred into ice-cold low calcium artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (ACSFPFC) and bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 containing (in mM): 220 sucrose, 3 KCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose. For electrophysiological recordings, 200-μm coronal slices were prepared using a vibratome (VT 1200s, Leica, Germany). Slices were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in normal ACSFPFC containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 26.2 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.5 MgSO4, 1 NaH2PO4, 2.5 CaCl2, and 11 glucose (95% O2/5% CO2). Brainstem slices containing the MNTB were prepared from postnatal days 8–10 (p8 – p10) Sprague Dawley rats of either sex as reported previously. The pups were killed by decapitation, and a block of brain tissue containing the brainstem was quickly placed into the ice-cold low calcium solution (ACSFcalyx), containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.05 CaCl2, 3 MgCl2, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.4 L-ascorbic acid, 3 myo-inositol, and 2 Na-pyruvate (95% O2/5% CO2). For electrophysiological recordings, 200-μm coronal slices were prepared using a vibratome (VT 1200s, Leica, Germany). Slices were incubated for at least 30 min at 37 °C in normal ACSFcalyx containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.4 L-ascorbic acid, 3 myo-inositol, and 2 Na-pyruvate (95% O2/5% CO2). All studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Fudan University. All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Electrophysiology Whole-cell potassium currents in HEK293 cells and cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons were recorded using an Axopatch 200B or Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA). The extracellular solution contained (in mM): 135 NaCl, 3 KCl, 0.001 TTX, 10 glucose, 5 4-AP, 10 HEPES, and 2 MgCl2, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. The pipette (4–6 MΩ) solution contained (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, and 10 EGTA, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. Whole-cell potassium currents were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. A 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV was applied to induce a potassium current in HEK293 cells and cortical pyramidal neurons. To analyze the steady-state activation and inactivation of Kv2.2 currents, the normalized conductance or currents was fitted using the Boltzmann equation: G/Gmax = A2 + (A1 − A2)/(1 + exp((Vm − V1/2)/slope factor)). For cortical pyramidal neuron AP recordings, cortical slices were perfused in normal ACSFPFC solution; the pipette (3–5 MΩ) solution contained (in mM): 150 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 8 NaCl, 0.4 EGTA, 0.1 Na3-GTP, and 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH. A 1 s, 200-pA current was injected to induce AP trains. Single-channel recordings were made for the Kv2.2 channel in HEK293 cells using cell-attached mode in Axopatch 200B amplifier with Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices, USA), acquisition at 10 kHz, and filtering at 2 kHz. The extracellular and pipette solutions were the same as for the whole-cell recording in HEK293 cells. For leak subtractions, null sweeps (traces with no channel opening) were averaged and subtracted from the recordings. Single-channel analysis was accomplished with Clampfit10.7 (Molecular Devices, USA). The unitary conductance was determined from the slope of the linear fit of the channel current induced by depolarizing from −110 to +10 mV (20 mV step). To evaluate the potassium channel open probability, the patches were depolarized from the resting membrane potential (around −70 mV) to test potentials of +10 mV for 400 ms. The open probability was calculated from the total channel opening time divided by the duration of the depolarizing stimulus. Measurements of presynaptic IK and APs at the nerve terminal of the calyx-type synapse were taken with a sampling rate of 20 kHz using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Germany). To isolate the presynaptic Kv2.2 currents, TTX (1 μM) and 4-AP (5 mM) were added to the normal ACSFcalyx solution, substituting for NaCl with equal osmolarity. The presynaptic pipette (3–4 MΩ) solution contained (in mM): 125 K-gluconate, 20 KCl, 4 Mg-ATP, 10 Na2-phosphocreatine, 0.3 Na3-GTP, 10 HEPES, and 0.5 EGTA, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH. The series resistance (<10 MΩ) was compensated by 65% (10 μs lag). A 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV was applied to induce a potassium current. A 1 ms, 100–300 pA current was injected to evoke single presynaptic AP or AP trains. Burst firing was defined as a series of two or more APs with <10 ms intervals. For postsynaptic recordings at the principal neuron of calyx-type synapse, the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) were recorded with an EPC-10 amplifier. The postsynaptic pipette (2–3 MΩ) solution contained the same components as the presynaptic pipette solution, and the series resistance (<10 MΩ) was compensated by 90% (10 μs lag). The EPSC was induced as described previously. Briefly, a bipolar electrode was placed at the midline of the MNTB. A pair of 0.1 ms, 2–20 V stimuli with 20 ms interval was applied every 10 s, and the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated as the second EPSC (EPSC2) divided by the first EPSC (EPSC1). The EPSC40/EPSC1 ratio was calculated as the average of the last 10 EPSCs (EPSC31-EPSC40) divided by the EPSC1. The mEPSC was recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV with 50 μM APV, 0.5 μM TTX, and 10 μM bicuculline in the extracellular solution. All of the electrophysiological recordings mentioned above were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C). Cortisol (S1696, Selleck, USA), RU486 (mifepristone, S2606, Selleck, USA), and U0126 (S1102, Selleck, USA) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Dexamethasone (D4902, Sigma, USA), H-89 (B1427, Sigma, USA) and corticosterone (235135, Sigma, USA) were purchased from Sigma. Dexamethasone-BSA was purchased from Qiyue biotech. Bisindolylmaleimide I (HY-13867, MCE, USA) was purchased from MCE. TTX (14964, Cayman Chemical, USA) was purchased from Cayman Chemical. Staurosporine (ab120056, Abcam, UK) was purchased from Abcam. All drugs were dissolved in DMSO with a final concentration not exceeding 0.1%. Unless otherwise specified, all control groups were treated with 0.1% DMSO. The Kv2.1 (ab192761, Abcam, UK) and Kv2.2 (APC-120, Alomone, IL) antibodies were purchased from Abcam and Alomone Labs, respectively. Lentiviral production and injection Oligonucleotides specifying the shRNA was 5′-ATGGCAGAAAAGGCACCTCCTG GC-3′, and the scramble oligonucleotides was 5′-AAAGAACGGACCTCCCGGTCGGTA-3′. The shRNA hairpin sequences were inserted into MluI-ClaI sites of pLVTHM targeting vector. Lentivirus was produced in 293T cells using a packaging vector psPAX2, and an envelope plasmid, pMD2.G, as reported previously. The knockdown efficiency of the shRNA was tested in HEK293 cells transfected with Kv2.2 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Mice were anesthetized using pentobarbital sodium, and 1 μL virus was injected into the prefrontal cortex using a microsyringe pump. Three weeks after injection, layer 2 cortical pyramidal neurons with fluorescence were used for patch clamp recording. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR were performed as previously reported. Briefly, qRT-PCR was performed in 20 μL reactions containing: 2 μL of template, 0.4 μmol/L of each paired primer, and SYBR Green Polymerase Chain Reaction master mix. The thermocycling conditions were 94 °C, 10 min; 38 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s; and 72 °C, 8 min. Results were normalized by β-actin mRNA. Data were calculated by 2−ΔΔCt method and reported as fold change over control. Primers used in PCR: Kv2.2: forward 5′-CACCTGGCTTGAACAGAAAG, reverse 5′-TTGCTTCGGATAATGTCCAC; β-actin: forward 5′-GTGGACATCCGCAAAGAC, reverse 5′-AAAGGGTGTAACGC AACTAA. Western blot The mouse brain slices were incubated with cortisol for 5 min, and then the outmost layer (∼1-mm-thick) of the slices was cut off and collected for the Western blot experiments. HEK293 cells were treated with cortisol for 5 min. The homogenates of the cortical slices or HEK293 cell homogenates were prepared using a HEPES-NP40 lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3VO4) with protease inhibitor (P8340, Sigma, USA) and phosphatase inhibitor (P5726, Sigma, USA) cocktail. For cell surface expression experiments, HEK293 cell membrane proteins were isolated using the membrane protein extraction kit (P0033, Beyotime, China). The protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to polyvinyldifluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C (anti-ERK, 1:1000, 4695S, Cell Signaling Technology, USA; anti-pERK, 1:1000, 4370S, Cell Signaling Technology, USA; anti-beta-tubulin, 1:1000, M20005, Abmart, China). The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and imaged using the ChemiDoc XRS + imaging system from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA) and manufacturer's software. Molecular weight marker and chemiluminescent signal images were automatically overlaid by the manufacturer's software. The Western blot images were presented according to the recommendations from the report. Data analysis The IK, AP waveform, and EPSCs were measured using Igor Pro (v9.0.1, WaveMetrics, USA), and mEPSCs were measured with Mini Analysis (v6.07, Synaptosoft, USA). ImageJ (v1.53, NIH, USA) was used for quantitative analysis of the Western blot experiments. ERK expression was normalized to the expression of beta-tubulin. Data are given as the mean ± SEM; n indicates the number of cells tested or independent experiments in Western blot. Paired Student's t-test was used to compare two samples, and one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare multiple samples. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Igor Pro and GraphPad Prism (v9.4, GraphPad Software Inc, USA).

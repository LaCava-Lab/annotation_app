YC-1 Curtails Ischemia-Induced Downregulation of Basal ZnT8 Expression in the Injured Retina. Quantitative Real-Rime RT-PCR analysis was conducted by utilizing specific primer sets (A). The levels of ZnT8 mRNA in the non-treated ischemic retinas were significantly downregulated by approximately 3.05 folds, as compared to nontreated normoxic retinas. Dual injections treatment with YC-1 has resulted in a significant upregulation of ZnT8 (**P<0.01) gene expression when compared with DMSO-treated hypoxic cells. ANOVA; Mean ± SEM of mRNA level normalized to β-actin were calculated, (**P<0.01, as compared to DMSO-treated retinas). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (B). Immunohistochemical localization of ZnT8 in the Mouse Retina has indicated that in the non-treated normoxic retina; the ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the retina exhibited the strongest ZnT8 expression, whereas the PRL, INL and IPL exhibited moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. An image with high level of magnification (marked with circle) shows staining of the cell bodies in the GCL. Scale bar: 200 µm (C). Characterization of ZnT8-immunoreactivity in Normal, Pathological and YC-1-Treated Retinas. Photomicrographs of retinas from various OIR groups that were immunostained for ZnT8 exhibit a downregulation of ZnT8 expression in the non-treated ischemic (B) and DMSO-treated groups (C), as compared with non-treated normoxic group (A). While ZnT8 immunoreactivities were upregulated in the YC-1-treated group (D), as compared with DMSO-treated groups. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. Scale bar: 150 µm. Quantitative Assessments of Retinal Immunohistochemical Staining Intensity of ZnT8 in Normal, Pathological and YC-1-Treated Retinas. The retinal layers stained vividly. However, the grain intensity varied significantly from one layer to another. The intensity of immunoreactivity was graded as follows: strong (+++), moderate (++), weak (+), negative (−) (A). Retinal tissue specimens of YC-1 treated groups were compared to normoxic, non-treated ischemic and DMSO-treated retinas. The collected images of the retinas were imported to the image analysis system Metamorph 7.1. All image analyses were conducted in a masked fashion. Values obtained from at least 5 retinal fields were used to calculate the average pixel intensity value per retina. Bar graphs exhibit the intensity of staining of ZnT8 in all four groups. The area of staining was measured in (um2/um2) in all four groups. Values (mean ± SEM), from 3 separate experiments from at least 10 images from 4 different eyes/group. (***P<0.001 and **P<0.01). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (B). YC-1 Restores ZnT8 to its Basal Homeostatic Levels, in vitro.
 rMC-1 cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The mRNA levels of ZnT8 were downregulated in non-treated hypoxic cells; while normoxic cells exhibited remarkable high mRNA levels. Treatment of hypoxic rMC-1 cells with various concentrations of YC-1 resulted in a significant upregulation of ZnT8 mRNA expression as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic cells. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Mean ± SEM of mRNA level normalized to β-actin were calculated, (***P<0.001 and **P<0.01 as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic control). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (A). The protein expression levels of ZnT8 were significantly elevated in the normoxic cells, as compared to cells that were exposed to hypoxic conditions. In YC-1-treated hypoxic cells, ZnT8 protein expression was significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion, compared with DMSO-treated hypoxic cells, which exhibited a significant ZnT8 downregulation. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA (**P<0.01). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (B). Graphs exhibit the densitometric analysis relative to that measured in non-treated hypoxic control. Relative ratio represented the intensities of ZnT8 protein expressions in rMC-1 cells relative to those of β-actin expression, whereas the relative ratio of normoxia control was defined as 100. Values, shown as the mean ± SEM, from 3 separate experiments with a total sample size of 6. (*P<0.05 **P<0.01 ***P<0.001) vs. DMSO-treated hypoxic control (C).

3. Materials and Methods 3.1. General Information The NMR data were gathered by using a Varian Agilent (Walnut Creek, CA, USA, 400 MHz for 1H- and 100 MHz for 13C) in CDCl3 and CD3OD. Chemical shifts were reported in units (ppm) relative to the signal of Tetramethylsilane (TMS) and coupling constants (J) in Hz. The GC-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent Technologies (Wilmington, DE, USA) 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer detector Agilent Technologies 5973N. The instrument was equipped whit a DB5-MS Agilent 122-5532 column (length 30 m, internal diameter 0.25 mm thickness of the stationary phase: 0.25 μm). Helium (1 mL/min) was the carrier gas and the injector was operated in split mode (ratio 1:1) at a temperature of 250 °C. The oven was programmed with an initial temperature of 50 °C for 1 min, then increased to 270 °C at 10°/min and kept at 270° for 25 min. Silica gel 60 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, from 0.063 to 0.200 mm) and RP-18 (Merck 40–63 µm) were used as stationary phases for column chromatography. All organic solvents were bought in Brenntag (Brengtan, Guayaquil, Ecuador), then distilled. Optical rotations were measured using an Automatic Polarimeter (Jinan Hanon Instruments Co. Ltd. Jinan, China) MRC P810 with Hanon was used. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase assays were evaluated using α-amylase from porcine pancreas (Type IV-B, Sigma A3176, St. Louis, MO, USA) and α-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tipe I, Sigma G5003, St. Louis, MO, USA). Starch was used as substrate for α-amylase and p-Nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopiranoside (p-NPG-Sigma, N1377) was used as substrate for α-glucosidase. For both enzymatic tests, a microplate reader (EPOCH 2, Biotek Instruments Inc. Winoosky, VT, USA) was used. 3.2. Plant Material The leaves of M. tamnifolia were collected in the flowering stage in the locality of “Cerro Gañil”, province of Loja, Ecuador, in February 2015, at 2987 m.a.s.l. (Meters above sea level, coordinates 686617 N; 9602180 E). The plant material was identified by Nixon Cumbicus and, voucher specimens (PPN-PL-006) are deposited at the Herbarium HUTPL at the Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja. 3.3. Extraction and Isolation of Compounds The dried leaves of M. tamnifolia, (500 g) were macerated for 1 h in a series of solvents according to a rule of increasing polarity: hexane (Hex), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanol (MeOH), each solvent 6 L three times. The obtained solutions were filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure, to get three total extracts: 6.25 g (Hex) 6.35 g (EtOAc), and 63.34 g (MeOH). The hexane extract (3 g) was submitted to silica column chromatography, with an extract/silica ratio of 1:55. The column was eluted according to a gradient of increasing polarity, from hexane-ethyl acetate 90:10 to 100% ethyl acetate, obtaining a total of 16 fractions (MM01-5/MM16-5). The fraction MM01-5 was purified by column chromatography, with an isocratic system of Hex–CH2Cl2 80:20 to get compound 1 (70 mg). The fraction MM03-5 was purified by column chromatography, with an isocratic system of Hex–CH2Cl2 90:10 to obtain compound 2 (10 mg). The fraction MM04-5, eluted in isocratic conditions with Hex–EtOAc 80:20, afforded compound 3 (45 mg). The fraction MM06-5, eluted in isocratic conditions with Hex–EtOAc 70:30, afforded compound 4 (20 mg). The ethyl acetate extract (3 g) was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, with an extract/silica ratio of 1:50 and an increasing polarity gradient of Hex–EtOAc from 95:5 to 100% ethyl acetate. Finally, the column was extracted with acetone 100%, obtaining a total of 20 fractions (MM01-12–MM20-12). The fraction MM06-12 was purified by column chromatography, with an isocratic system of Hex–EtOAc 90:10, to obtain compound 5 (16 mg). The fraction MM09-12 was eluted with an isocratic system of Hex–EtOAc 70:30 to get compound 6 (34 mg). The methanol extract (5 g) was submitted to a partition with a mixture of MeOH–H2O 95:5 and, n-Hexane (1:1 volume ratio), obtaining a polar extract of 3.68 g. The polar extract was fractionated by silica gel column chromatography, eluting with increasing polarity from CH2Cl2–MeOH 95:5 to CH2Cl2–MeOH 70:30, obtaining a total of five fractions (MM01-40 to MM05-40). The fraction MM02-40, was purified by direct phase column chromatography, eluting with increasing polarity gradient from EtOAc–Hex 80:20 to 100% EtOAc, to get compound 7 (13 mg) and compound 8 (13 mg). The fraction MM04-40 was purified on reversed phase column chromatography, with an isocratic system of MeOH–H2O 90:10, to obtain compound 9 (15 mg). 3.4. Measurement of α-Amylase Inhibitory Activity The inhibitory activity is measured according to the method reported by Xiao et al. with slight modifications. Acarbose was used as the positive control. Starch solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g in 50 mL of 0.4 M NaOH and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling in iced water, the solution pH was adjusted to 7 with 2 M HCl and H2O was added to complete 100 mL. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH:H2O (50:50). Several dilutions in PBS (SIGMA-P4417) were made in case of getting complete enzyme inhibition. PBS solution (35 μL), substrate (35 μL) and sample (5 μL) solutions were mixed in a 96-well microtiter plate, and the mixture was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 1 min. Then, 20 μL of a 50 μg/mL α-amylase solution was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μL of 0.1 M HCl and then 150 μL of 0.5 mM iodine solution (0.5 mM I2 and 0.5 mM KI) were added. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (EPOCH 2, Biotek Instruments Inc. Winoosky, VT, USA) at 580 nm. Inhibitory activity (%) was calculated according to the formula described by Kusano et al. as follows:  where ABS1 is the absorbance of the incubated solution containing sample, starch and amylase, ABS2 is the absorbance of incubated solution containing sample and starch, ABS3 is the absorbance of incubated solution containing starch and amylase, and ABS4 is the absorbance of incubated solution containing starch. IC50 value was calculated by curve fitting of data (GraphPad Prism 5.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). Acarbose was used as positive control. 3.5. α-Glucosidase Inhibition Assay α-Glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined using a 96-well microtiter plate with p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside as the substrate, according to the method describe by Tao et al., with slight modifications. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH:H2O (50:50). Several dilutions in PBS were made in case of getting complete enzyme inhibition. First, 75 μL of PBS (SIGMA-P4417) was mixed with 5 μL of the sample and 20 μL of the enzyme solution (0.15 U/mL in PBS pH 7.4), then it was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reaction by adding the substrate. After pre-incubation, 20 μL of PNPG (5 mM in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was added and then incubated at 37 °C. The amount of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) released was measured in an EPOCH 2 (BIOTEK®) microplate reader at 405 nm for 60 min, recording the absorbance every 5 min. The results were expressed as inhibition percentage by means of the formula described by Choi et al. as follows:  where A0 is the absorbance recorded for the enzymatic activity without inhibitor (control), and As is the absorbance recorded for the enzymatic activity in presence of the inhibitor (sample). IC50 value was calculated by curve fitting of data (GraphPad Prism 5.0). Acarbose was used as positive control. 3.6. Physical and Spectral Data of Isolated Compounds Lupeol acetate (1).

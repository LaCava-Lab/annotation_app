Background Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin (PS) modulate PS/γ-secretase activity and therefore contribute to AD pathogenesis. Previously, we found that PS/γ-secretase cleaves voltage-gated sodium channel β2 subunits (Navβ2), releases the intracellular domain of Navβ2 (β2-ICD), and thereby increases intracellular sodium channel α-subunit Nav1.1 levels. Here, we tested whether FAD-linked PS1 mutations modulate Navβ2 cleavages and Nav1.1 levels. Objective To analyze the effects of PS1-linked FAD mutations on Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 levels in neuronal cells. Methods We first generated B104 rat neuroblastoma cells stably expressing Navβ2 and wild-type PS1, PS1 with one of three FAD mutations (E280A, M146L, or Δ-E9), or PS1 with a non-FAD mutation (D333G). Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 protein and mRNA levels were then analyzed by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR, respectively. Results The FAD-linked E280A mutation significantly decreased PS/γ-secretase-mediated processing of Navβ2 as compared to wild-type PS1 controls, both in cells and a cell-free system. Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the surface levels of Nav channel α-subunits, were also significantly reduced in PS1 (E280A) cells. Conclusion Our data indicate that the FAD-linked PS1 E280A mutation decreases Nav channel levels by partially inhibiting PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Navβ2 in neuronal cells.

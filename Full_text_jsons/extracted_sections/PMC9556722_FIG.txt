Schematic representation of the study cohort and design. (A) Patients with myelofibrosis (MF), treated or not with ruxolitinib (Ruxo), and healthy controls (HC) were immunized with three doses of mRNA vaccines anti SARS-CoV-2. (B) Antibody and B-cell responses were evaluated at the baseline and after the second and the third vaccination dose. Humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with myelofibrosis (MF) after the second and the third dose of mRNA vaccine. (A) Spike-specific IgG titres were assessed by ELISA in plasma of patients with MF, treated or not with ruxolitinib (Ruxo), and healthy controls (HC), at baseline (pre v1), and after two and three vaccine doses. Antibody end point titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the sample dilution reporting double the background OD value. (B) Time course of spike-specific IgG in plasma collected at the baseline (pre v1) and after two (post v2) and three (post v3) doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. (C) SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization assay was tested at baseline (pre v1), post v2 and post v3 in plasma by evaluating ACE2/RBD binding inhibition activity. Results are expressed as ACE2/RBD binding inhibition percentage with box and whiskers diagram showing all subject values. Inhibition values ≥30% are considered a positive result according to the manufacturer indication. (D) Percentage of subjects developing ACE2/RBD inhibition binding positive values (≥30%) in different groups. Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post test for multiple comparisons, was used for assessing statistical differences between groups. Unpaired Mann-Whitney test was used to assess statistical difference for each group at different time point. *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001. Spike-specific B cell response following mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with myelofibrosis (MF), with or without ruxolitinib (Ruxo) treatment, after second and third vaccine dose. Identification of spike (S) and RBD-specific B cells by flow cytometry within PBMCs collected at the baseline (pre v1), after two (post v2) and three (post v3) doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. (A) Gating strategy for identifying CD19+ spike/RBD-specific B cells (named S+RBD+ B cells) by multiparametric flow cytometry. (B) Representative dot plot analysis of spike PE versus RBD APC within CD19+ cells, for identifying S+RBD+ B cells in MF subjects with and without therapy, and in healthy controls (HC). (C) Mean value (±SEM) of S+RBD+ B cells percentages at different time points evaluated in MF subjects with and without therapy, and in HC. (D) Frequencies of S+RBD+ B cells on CD19+ cells at different time points evaluated in MF subjects with and without therapy, and in HC. Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post test for multiple comparisons, was used for assessing statistical differences between different groups each time point. Unpaired Mann-Whitney test was used to assess statistical difference at each group at different time points. *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001. Time course of spike-specific antibody and B cell responses in plasma of myelofibrosis (MF) patients after the second and third SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine dose. Nineteen MF patients, 8 with ruxolitinib (Ruxo) treatment (A, C, E) and 11 without therapy (B, D, F), were monitored after two (post v2) and three (post v3) doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to study the kinetic of spike-specific IgG (A, B), the ACE2/RBD binding inhibition activity (C, D) and the spike/+RBD+-specific B cells generated (E, F). Each subject is identified with a number and a color, as reported in the legend.

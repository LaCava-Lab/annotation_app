CBX2 is upregulated in GC cell lines and CBX2 knockdown inhibits the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) CBX2 expression in GC cell lines was analyzed using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. (B) Expression of CBX2 in normal or GC cells was determined via western blotting. (C) CBX2 mRNA levels were analyzed via RT-qPCR. (D) mRNA expression of CBX2 was also evaluated via RT-qPCR to determine the transfection efficiency of shRNA-CBX2. (E) Expression of β-catenin, c-myc and cyclin D1 were determined via western blotting and (F) semi-quantified. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 vs. GES-1 or Control. CBX2, chromobox homolog 2; GC, gastric cancer; RT-qPCR, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; NC, negative control. CBX2 knockdown inhibits the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway. (A) DKK1 mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR to evaluate the transfection efficiency of shRNA-DKK1. (B) A Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was performed to detect the viability of MFC cells transfected with or without shRNA-CBX2 and shRNA-DKK1. (C) Proliferation was determined by performing a colony formation assay following MFC cell transfection.

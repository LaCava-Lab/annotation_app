Methods Cloning and expression HMPV L and P genes (from hMPV isolate CAN97–83, Genbank: AY297749.1) codon-optimized for expression in Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells, were chemically synthesized and cloned into modified pFastBacDual (Thermo Fischer Scientific) by Bio Basic Inc. (Singapore). HMPV L (protein sequence Genbank: AAQ67700.1) was inserted downstream of a Strep-tag-II followed by a TEV cleavage sequence. Strep-TEV-HMPV L was inserted downstream of polyhedrin promoter on pFastBacDual. HMPV P (protein sequence Genbank: AAQ67693.1) was inserted downstream of an 8× His-tag sequence, followed by a TEV cleavage sequence. 8×His-TEV-HMPV P was inserted downstream of p10 promoter on pFastBacDual. We mutated pFastBacDual_HMPV_L:P by plasmid PCR to generate pFastBacDual_HMPV_LD745A:P using forward primer 5’-GACGTGTCCAAGCCTGTGAAGCTGTC and reverse primer 5’-GATGGACTGGTTCGCGCCGTTGAGC. The mutation was confirmed by sequencing. Generation and isolation of bacmid of HMPV_L:P and HMPV_LD745A:P followed bac to bac expression system instructions manual (Invitrogen). Viral stocks generated from purified bacmids were amplified and used for protein expression. Protein purification Sf9 cells pellet was resuspended in 1/10 of cultured volume in cold HMPV L:P lysis buffer, 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 15 mM imidazole, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was incubated with 3 mL pre-equilibrated nickel-NTA beads (Thermo Fisher) per liter of cell pellet for 2 hours at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pelleted beads were subjected to washes at 15 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM imidazole with 40, 30 and 20 bed volumes, respectively. Washed beads were transferred into a gravity flow column for elution. HMPV L:P complex was eluted in HMPV L:P His-trap elution buffer containing 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, through gravity flow at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were analyzed using SDS PAGE and stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon) to visualize the HMPV L and P proteins (Extended data Fig. 1a). Fractions containing the HMPV L:P complex were pooled with the addition of 1/10 (mg/ml) of TEV and subjected to dialysis against HMPV L:P lysis buffer with no imidazole at 4 °C overnight. Cleaved HMPV L:P protein was incubated with 1 mL nickel-NTA beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Flow-through and wash fractions containing L:P were pooled and subjected to heparin chromatography: a 5 mL HiTrap Heparin (GE healthcare) column was equilibrated with 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP and protein sample was loaded, washed with the same buffer, and eluted using a buffer containing 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP. Fractions containing pure L:P were pooled, concentrated and loaded onto a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP. Fractions collected were subjected to SDS PAGE and instant blue staining. Fractions containing L:P complex were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin15R with a 100 kDa cutoff concentrator (Sartorius) to a concentration of 0.85 mg/mL for cryo-EM. The final yield for the L:P complex used for cryo EM was 0.045 mg/L. During the heparin chromatographic step, a large excess of P was observed to flow through the heparin column. This fraction was further purified by size exclusion using a superdex 200 10/300 column (GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP and the pure P was finally concentrated in a Vivaspin15R concentrator (10 kDa cut-off). The yield of free P was 0.23 mg/L. In order to obtain protein for the polymerization assay, both the wild-type L:P and LD745A:P mutant were purified following the same procedure, but without the heparin chromatographic step. The L protein in the L:P preparations was quantified by separation on SDS-PAGE and detection using colloidal blue staining. The molar concentration of L:P was determined with respect to L. RdRp activity assays PAGE-purified RNA oligo-ribonucleotides representing residues 1–14 (Fig. 1d) or 1–25 (Extended data Fig. 2b) of the le sequence purchased from Sigma were used as a template for in vitro RNA synthesis. Purified recombinant HMPV L:P at a concentration of 13 nM was incubated with 1 μM RNA oligonucleotide in a total reaction volume of 20 μL in vitro transcription buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mM KCl, 5.0 mM MgCl2, 0.2 U/μL murine RNase inhibitor, 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 1 mM DTT). The reactions were pre-equilibrated on ice for 30 min. Transcription reactions were initiated by the addition of rNTPs (1 mM each of rATP, rGTP and rCTP, 20 μM rUTP) and 20 nM [α-32P] rUTP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer) or as indicated in the legends and incubated at 30° C for 3 hours. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of deionized formamide. After addition of proteinase K, the reaction mixtures were further incubated at 37° C for 20 min. The reaction products were heat-denatured for 10 min at 95° C and ¼ of the reaction volume was resolved by denaturing urea PAGE (20% acrylamide, 0.5× TBE). Gels were subsequently dried onto a positively charged Hybond N+ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) and imaged using a phosphorimager. Data are representative of three independent experiments. The length of the RNA products of the RdRp activity assay was determined by comparison with 3-nt and 25-nt long 5’-triphospho-oligo-RNAs synthesised in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P] rATP incorporation. Succinctly, annealed complementary DNA oligonucleotides representing a class II T7 phage promoter followed by the anticipated 25-nt Tr RNA product sequence were incubated with T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolab) and [α-32P] rATP according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To generate the 3-nt long 5’-triphospho-oligo-RNA marker (5’-pppACG), reaction was performed under the same experimental conditions except that rGTP was substituted with 3ʹ-dGTP chain terminator. To characterize the 3′ extension activity of HMPV polymerase on the RNA template, the le25 template was labelled with E. coli poly(A) polymerase (New England Biolab) in the presence of [α-32P] rATP and excess of the chain-terminating analogue cordycepin 3′-triphosphate (3′-dATP). A quantity of 1 μM RNA was incubated (37° C, 60 min) with 0.25 U/μL E. coli poly(A) polymerase in reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 250 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2) supplemented with 20 μM 3ʹ-dATP and 100 nM [α-32P] rATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Perkin Elmer). Primer elongation reactions contained 2 μM template (containing a 3´phosphate group), 20 μM primer (containing a 5´- hydroxyl group) and 20 μM each rATP, rCTP, rGTP and rUTP, with 60 nM [α-32P] rGTP tracer in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT and 10% glycerol. Primer elongation was initiated by the addition of HMPV L:P to a concentration of 20 nM in a total reaction volume of 25 μL. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 30˚C. After heat inactivation for 3 min at 90˚C, reactions were heat denatured for 5 min at 95˚C in an equal volume of 10 mM EDTA in deionized formamide with 0.02% each bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol dyes. 7 μL of the 50 μL stopped reaction mix were subjected to denaturing urea PAGE (20% acrylamide, 7 M urea, 1× TBE). The gel was dried onto 3MM chromatography paper and the radiolabelled products were detected by phosphorimager analysis. Cryo Electron Microscopy We glow-discharged Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3 holey carbon 200-mesh copper grids (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Großlöbichau, Germany) at 20 mA for 45 seconds. To vitrify the sample, we applied 3.5 μL of the HMPV L:P complex (both diluted to 0.8 mg/mL) to each grid, and plunge-froze in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) after a 4.0-second blotting (offset -2) with filter papers pre-saturated for 15 minutes under 100 % humidity. We screened the sample homogeneity and cryo preparation in an Oxford-style CT3500 cryo-specimen holder (Gatan Inc, Pleasanton, CA) on a liquid nitrogen cooling Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI, Lausanne, Switzerland), operated at 200 kV and equipped with a K2 summit direct detector (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). We screened for thin and clean ice with maximum distribution of non-overlapping protein particles. Sample homogeneity was judged by visual observation and by 2D classification (Extended data Fig. 1). We optimized and prepared two sets of cryo-grids, one with the purified L:P sample and the other with purified L:P supplemented with the free P sample at a 1:0.4 molar ratio. We automated data acquisition using SerialEM on a K2 summit detector (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA) equipped to a Tecnai Polara electron microscope (FEI, Lausanne, Switzerland) operated at 300 kV and at a nominal magnification of 31,000×. The calibrated physical pixel size was 1.24 Å corresponding to a calibrated magnification of 40,323× on the camera sensor plane. We confirmed beam parallelization by collecting a few movies on carbon after comma-free and objective astigmatism alignments and prior to the actual data collection; the Thon rings of carbon images consistently extended beyond 2.9–2.7 Å and were of excellent stigmation (Extended data Fig. 1). For all datasets, we recorded 40 frames/movie in super-resolution mode (0.62 Å/pixel) using a dose rate of 9.2 electrons/physical pixel/second (1.24 Å/pixel), and a total exposure of 48 electrons/Å2. We recorded a total of 7,438 and 1,100 dose-fractionated images for the L:P sample and L:P supplemented with P sample, respectively. Image processing We aligned the super resolution movie frames using MotionCor2 with dose filtering and 5 by 5 patched sub-frame alignment; the frames were binned over 2 by 2 super-resolution “pixels” in Fourier space, yielding the physical pixel size of 1.24 Å of the saved micrographs. We binned the motion-corrected micrographs by a factor of 4 (4.96 Å/pixel) and low-pass filtered to 15 Å for visual examination. We discarded those of thick ice, abnormal defocus, or large carbon areas. For particle picking and 2D classification, we down-sampled the micrographs to 2.48 Å/pixel in Fourier space using resample_mp.exe to facilitate computation. We manually picked particles for 10 representative micrographs using e2boxer.py and used these boxes to train the auto-picking model in crYOLO. We then used the trained model to automatically pick particles from all micrographs with the crYOLO Phosaurus network. We visually reviewed the results and manually improved the automatically picked boxes for the 10 micrographs, while incorporating missed representative micrographs for the next round training. We repeated the crYOLO training/autopicking procedures until all particles were accurately picked and well centered from all micrographs. The final L:P data contained a total of 5,381,943 particles, while that of L:P supplemented with P contained 606,410 particles. We determined the defocus values and defocus angles of the unbinned (1.24 Å/pixel) micrographs using ctffind4. The Thon ring fitting resolution (reported by ctffind4) of most selected micrographs consistently fell into the 2.9~3.3 Å range (Extended data Fig. 1), indicating good data quality. We performed 2D classification in Relion until all high-quality 2D class images became apparent (within 50 iterations). We only selected the best 2D classes judged by visual examination and by the resolution and other statistics reported by Relion, retaining 880,724 particles for 3D analysis. To speed-up computation, we started the initial 3D analysis with the data downsampled to 2.48 Å/pixel. We generated the ab initio model (3 classes) using Relion, and selected the best class as a reference model for further data analysis. We performed one round of mode 3 alignment for the 2D class images against the 3D initial model in frealign (version 9.11), with CTF correction turned off. We then calculated projection matching using frealign (version 9.11) to cross-validate the 3D model and to confirm the 2D class selection as a self-consistency test. We performed 3D classification straightly with 6 classes in Relion until convergence (within 50 iterations). Two classes were clearly of high quality and superimposed well, with a cross correlation coefficient higher than 99%. We combined these two classes, yielding a total of 437,611 particles. The handedness of the maps was confirmed to be correct as judged by well-defined α-helices. From this point on, we scaled the alignment parameters to 1.24 Å/pixel and used the full resolution data for further analysis. Relion auto-refinement of these particles produced a map of 4.0-Å resolution. We further improved the resolution to 3.9-Å after refining the per-particle motion in Relion and to 3.8 Å after beam tilt refinement by treating all particles as one group. Refining the defocus of individual particles did not yield obvious improvement. We confirmed convergence of motion correction by another round of per-particle motion refinement, which yielded no apparent improvement. Nonetheless, the quality of this map at 3.8-Å resolution was excellent, as judged by main-chain continuity and side-chain densities (Extended data Fig. 1g, h). We further classified the 437,611 particles into six classes and discarded four junk classes, yielding a total of 302,346 particles. We auto-refined the two good classes individually or combined and again they overlapped nearly perfectly. We then gave the data more weights by adjusting the T number in Relion and later performed masked alignment, while correcting FSC for effects of the solvent mask. We visually examined the results and found out that a T number of 4 produced the best map without apparent signs of over-fitting. This combined with another round of per-particle motion refinement, beam tilt refinement, and per particle defocus refinement eventually yielded a map at 3.7 Å. In an effort to improve the density associated with P, we generated masks for P and L using Chimera segger and performed multi-body refinement using Relion, with the orientation of P relative to L fixed. We also subtracted the L signal from the 2D images, excised P from the 2D images, and performed 3D classification without alignment. Neither approach improved the P density, perhaps due to insufficient signal considering the small size of P. The final map was at 3.7 Å resolution and was sharpened with a B factor value of −188.25 Å2. The procedure is summarized in Extended Data Fig. 3. We followed the same data processing paradigm with minor adjustments for the dataset of the L:P preparation supplemented with P. The classification results were consistent with the L:P dataset, leaving 273,574 and 65,398 particles for the good classes after 2D classification and a first round of 3D classification, respectively. The final map after a second round of 3D classification was at 4.1-Å resolution from 29,376 particles and was nearly identical to the map from the L:P dataset. Hence, we mainly used the map from the L:P dataset for map interpretation, except for two less well-defined C-terminal helices of two P subunits (P3 and P4). Model building and refinement We built the atomic model using the graphics programs O and Coot. First, we fitted the RdRp and capping enzymatic domains of the VSV-L model (PDB access code: 5A22) into the map as well as the coiled-coil domain of P (PDB access code: 4BXT) and then used these as a guide for finding main-chain connectivity. Local resolution analysis indicated that the majority of the core portion of the complex falls within a resolution range of 3.0–3.6 Å, with excellent main-chain connectivity and side chain densities throughout the molecules (Extended Data Fig 1g, h). The majority of the electron density showed excellent continuity giving confidence for tracing the α–carbon chain. Moreover, in most regions, clear electron density for side chains allowed us to unambiguously assign the sequence register. We only observed weak and disordered extra density accounting for a portion of the CD and CRVI+ domains in maps sharpened with lower B factors and/or low-pass filtered with lower spatial frequency, suggesting that these domains are highly flexible in the complexes we examined. The appendage of HMPV-L might become fixed with respect to the ring-shaped core domain upon binding to a peptide encompassing residues 35–106 of the VSV-P used in the VSV-L study. Indeed, a recent study of the rabies virus L protein in complex with the counterpart of this P peptide demonstrates such contacts between P and L (Josh Horwitz and Stephen C. Harrison, personal communication). Although there were some stretches of weaker densities for the P protein, long side-chains of arginine and lysine residues ensured the correct polarity and register assignment of the sequence. We further confirmed that the sequence was in register by comparing the model with the coiled-coil interface of the known structure of the phosphoprotein tetramerization region (PDB code: 4BXT). Overall, we traced the entire NTD subdomain and RdRp domain spanning residues 8–892, except for mobile residues 1–7 (predicted to be disordered using the PrDOS prediction server http://prdos.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/top.cgi), 607–625 (603–625 are predicted to be disordered), the complete capping enzyme domain (residues 893–1380) and the four P subunits (residues 169–266, 171–236, 168–219, and 169–193/204–231 of subunits P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively). Residues 194–203 of subunit P4 are disordered. While the sequences could be assigned unambiguously for P1 and P2 residues as well as for the coiled coil region of P3 and P4, the sequence assignment for the C-terminal ends of P3 and P4 that are predicted to form helices is less certain. These segments might become fully ordered only in the presence of the ribonucleoprotein (see main text). Model building was interspersed with refinement using the real space refinement option in the package PHENIX (rigid_body, minimization_global, local grid searching and ADP) for the coordinates and B factors. We applied Ramachandran, rotamer and secondary structure restraints throughout the refinement, in addition to the standard geometry and B factor restraints. Over 40 rounds of manual rebuilding and phenix real space refinement were carried out until we had high confidence of the sequence register, density fitting, model geometry and local chemical environments. We analyzed the final model with MolProbity and statistics are given in Extended Data Table 1. We deposited the refined coordinates to wwPDB (PDB access code: 6U5O) and the electron density map to EMDB (EMDB access code: EMD-20651). Modeling of the polymerase: RNA elongation complex We fitted a rotavirus in situ elongation complex (PDB ID 6OJ3) to the HMPV L:P complex by superimposing the CA atoms of the 5 functional polymerase motifs in the program O and refined the alignment using the O command lsq_improve. The relatively long RNA allowed us to easily identify the NTP entry, template entry, template exit, and transcript exit tunnels in the HMPV L structure. Modeling using elongation complexes of other polymerases such as influenza virus PB1 (PDB code: 6QCT), the HCV NS5 (PDB code: 4WTG) and reovirus λ3 elongation complex (PDB code 1N35) confirmed the results. Tunnel identification We identified the tunnels in the structure using voidoo, mama and mapman of the Uppsala Software Factory. We tested values for the probe radius in the range of 1.4–2.0 Å and 1.8 Å yielded the most accurate tunnels. We generated pseudo-atoms to define the range of the calculation and displayed the tunnel along with the models in PyMOL (https:pymol.org). We performed object-specific clipping of the tunnel mask using PovRay (http://www.povray.org) to display its interior along with the modeled RNA. Tandem Mass spectrometry We performed tandem mass spectrometry data collection and analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8) for both the purified L:P complex and free P following a standard protocol. Briefly, we digested 2 μg of each sample over night at 37°C with trypsin (1:100 enzyme:sample molar ratio). Digests were carried out in 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5 in presence of 2% acetonitrile (v/v) with trypsin (Promega #V5111). After peptide purification by reversed phase C18 chromatography 1 μg of peptides was separated with a 4-hour acetonitrile gradient by HPLC prior to injection. Data were collected using an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 75 μm inner diameter capillary column used was packed with C18 resin (Accucore 2.6 μm). The scan sequence started with collection of an MS spectrum (Orbitrap analysis; resolution 120,000; mass range 400–1400 Th). MS2 analysis followed collision-induced dissociation (CID, CE=35) with a maximum ion injection time of 250 ms and an isolation window of 1.2 Da. Neutral loss of phosphate was taken into account by using a multi-stage activation (MSA) method with a neutral loss of 97.9763 Da. Peptides were searched with a SEQUEST-based algorithm against an insect database containing L and P protein sequences and common contaminants in addition. Searches were performed with a target decoy database strategy and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% set for peptide-spectrum matches followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) filtering and a final collapsed protein-level FDR of 1%. We dynamically searched for oxidized methionine (+15.9949146221 Da) and phospho-serine, -threonine and -tyrosine (+79.9663304104 Da). Phosphorylation site localization used a modified Anova score (ModScore). We repeated the experiments twice and the results were consistent. RSV priming loop experiments Mutations in codon-optimized RSV L (strain A2) were generated in a fragment of L ORF subcloned into a pGEM T easy vector (Promega). The W1262A substitution was generated by site-directed mutagenesis by Genscript, the P1261A, P1274A, Y1276A substitutions were generated using Q5 site directed mutagenesis (NEB). RSV P1261A was generated using forward primer 5′-ACCTACTAAGGCCTGGGTCGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCCTCTCGCCCCTGGTC-3′. RSV P1274A was generated using forward primer 5′-CCAGGAAAAAAAGACCATGGCCGTCTACAACAGG -3′ and reverse primer 5′- GTGGAGGAGCCGACCCAGGGCTTAGTAGG -3′. RSV Y1276A was generated using forward primer 5′-CATGCCCGTCGCCAACAGGCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCTTTTTTTCCTGGGTG-3′. The mutated ORF fragments were sequenced and then substituted in the codon optimized L ORF contained in a T7 expression vector (pTM1) by restriction digest and ligation. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations, and to ensure that no other changes were introduced during PCR-amplification steps. BSR-T7 cells, a BHK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses T7 polymerase (provided by Dr Karl Conzelmann), in six well dishes were transfected with pTM1 plasmids expressing the following proteins: RSV (A2 strain) N (400 ng/well), P (200 ng/well), M2–1 (100 ng/well), and L (or L mutant; 100 ng/well), and a plasmid expressing a minigenome RNA containing nt 1–36 of the trailer (tr) promoter at its 3´ end (200 ng/well). The minigenome was limited to synthesizing only the first strand of replication, by the lack of a promoter specific sequence at the 3´ end of the replicative intermediate. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 40–48 h post transfection, cells were harvested and RNA was purified using Trizol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that the RNA was subjected to a further round of purification by extraction with phenol-chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA products initiated within the tr promoter were analyzed by primer extension. RNA representing one-tenth of a well of cells were subjected to reverse transcription at 37˚C using the Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen) and a radiolabeled primer (5´-TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGAC-3´). One half the primer extension reaction was subjected to electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea in 1× TBE. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to cDNA representing initiation from positions +1 and +3 of the tr promoter were used as markers (+1, 5´-TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGACTTTTTTTCTCGT-3´; +3, 5´- TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGACTTTTTTTCTC-3´´). The same RNA samples, RNA representing one-tenth of a well of cells, were also subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose by northern blotting. The input minigenome template was detected using a radiolabeled strand-specific riboprobe. Primer extension products were visualized by autoradiography and the primer extension products and input minigenome were quantified using phosphorimager analysis. The levels of input minigenome were used to normalize for transfection efficiency. The data were normalized to the mean of the two WT samples included in each experiment. With the caveat that the sample sizes were an n of 3, statistical analysis using ANOVA showed that the levels of +1 and +3 RNA products for the P1261A and W1262A L variants were significantly different than those from wt L (p values of 0.002 and 0.003, respectively for +1; 0.004 for both variants for +3), whereas the levels of RNA produced from P1274A and Y1276A L variants were not statistically different (p values of 0.0385 and 0.549, respectively for +1; 0.227 and 0.518, respectively for +3). Figure preparation We prepared the figures and videos using PyMOL (Schrödinger LLC), Chimera, python matplotlib, gnuplot, CCP4 TopDraw, and PovRay (http://www.povray.org). Multiple sequence alignment was performed with Clustal Omega (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) and the alignment displayed with ESPript.

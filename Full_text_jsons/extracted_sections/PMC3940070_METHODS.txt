Methods Constructs, transfection, and cell lines The construct encoding full-length human Navβ2 containing a C-terminal V5/His tag was described previously. Constructs containing human wild-type PS1 (wtPS1) and PS1(ΔE9) and PS1(D333G) were a kind gift from Dr. John Hardy (NIH). For PS1(E280A) and PS1(M146L) constructs, mutations were introduced into wtPS1 by site-directed mutagenesis (Promega). Effectene (Qiagen) was used for transfection and individual clones were maintained in selection medium containing Zeocin (Invitrogen) and G418 (CellGro). Western Blot analysis, antibodies, and inhibitors Cell extraction and Western blot analyses were performed as previously described. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: anti-V5 (1:5000, Invitrogen), anti-Nav1.1 (1:250, Millipore), anti-pan Nav1 α (1:250, Millipore), anti-PS1 (1:250, Millipore), anti-GAPDH (1:250, Millipore), anti-NCadherin (1:1000, BD Transduction Laboratory), and anti-transferrin receptor (1:1000, Sigma). The γ-secretase inhibitors DAPT and L-685,458 were obtained from Calbiochem. Blots were quantified using the Versa Doc imaging system and Quantity One software (Biorad). Cell-free γ-secretase cleavage assay In vitro γ-secretase assay was performed as previously described. Purified membrane fractions were resuspended in a reaction buffer and incubated at 0 or 37 °C for two hours in the presence or absence of L-685,458. RNA Extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time RT-PCR Relative Nav1.1 mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described. All experiments were normalized to GAPDH controls. Cell Surface Biotinylation Cell surface biotinylation and detection of surface Nav1 α-subunits were performed as previously described.

Results 2-DE was used to screen for differentially expressed proteins that were associated with B. maydis infection. A total of 68 proteins were differentially expressed in the roots, stems, and leaves of soybeans at 72 h after inoculation. Some of these 68 proteins were similar to those of NHR components reported in previous studies, whereas others differed from those earlier described. Sixteen proteins in soybean leaves were induce after exposure to B. maydis  Leaf proteomic analysis of soybean NHR was performed to determine the mechanism underlying the response of soybean plants to B. maydis. Approximately 1,300 ± 50 protein spots were separated on 2-DE gels (Fig 1). The 18 protein spots showed significant changes (|ratio| > 2, P < 0.05). Among these, 16 proteins were further classified by using MALDI-TOF-MS as provided by AmiGO into five groups, including proteins related to metabolic processes, catalytic activity, developmental processes, cellular components (such as structural proteins), and defense response (Fig 1, Table 1). Eight of the nine metabolic proteins were located in chloroplasts. Of these, 6 proteins showed increased staining intensity and 2 proteins showed decreased staining intensity. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (here considered indicative of catalytic activity) was located in the nucleus, and its concentration increased by 9.2-fold. The spot representing the stress-response protein oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 increased in staining intensity. The spots representing 2 defense proteins, including acidic chitinase and trypsin inhibitor, also increased in staining intensity, mainly in the vacuole. The intensity of spot 74, which represented the V-type proton ATPase subunit B 1-like isoform 2, showed a decrease in staining intensity in the cytoplasm, whereas that of its subunit, B 2-like isoform 2, increased (Table 1). Some of these differentially expressed proteins are involved in metabolic processes, developmental processes, organization of cellular components, and catalytic activity. Expression of these particular proteins in soybean leaves was induced in response to B. maydis, together with the production of acidic chitinase and trypsin inhibitor. Twenty-five proteins were expressed in the stems of soybean plants in response to B. maydis  Several studies have documented that leaf and root proteomics can be used to interpret the responses of soybeans to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the stem protein response to pathogens is remains elusive. Here, 72 hpi stem proteomic analysis was performed to produce a more systemic understanding of how the three major organs (roots, stems, and leaves) of soybean plants are involved in the responses to the non-adapted pathogen B. maydis. Approximately 1,000 ± 50 protein spots were separated on 2-DE gels (Fig 2). Among these 26, 25 differentially expressed (|ratio| > 2, P < 0.05) proteins were successfully identified and sorted into five functional groups, including proteins associated with metabolic processes, cellular components, defense response, developmental processes, and molecular function (Table 2). Here, 48% of the stem proteins were determined to be involved in metabolic processes. The spots associated with half of these showed an increase in staining intensity with B. maydis infection, whereas half showed a decrease. Around 16% of the evaluated stem mitochondrial proteins showed a change in expression after infection, suggesting that NHR in soybeans is involved in significant energy consumption. Two of the mitochondrial proteins were related to heat shock 70, which is the protein chaperone that is responsible for the refolding and misfolding of proteins. A putative cysteine protease was grouped into the metabolic process group, although a previous study reported that it is involved in both developmental and pathogen-related PCD. Protein spots 4, 8, and 19 had functional annotations similar to those of Hsp70, although these were classified in different functional groups and were predicted to localize to different locations (mitochondrion and chloroplast), which was consistent with the diverse locations and functions of Hsps. The staining intensity of spot 19 (Hsp 70) showed a 12-fold increase relative to that of the controls. This phenomenon indicates that NHR in soybean is related to protein functional diversity. Protein spot 10 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase), protein spot 17 (26S protease regulatory subunit 6B homolog), and protein spot 25 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP20-2, chloroplastic-like isoform 2) were predicted to have more than one subcellular location. Protein spot 7 (oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, chloroplastic-like) was found to have been caused by the same protein as leaf protein spot 34, which showed a 2.5-fold increase in expression in leaves and a 11-fold increase expression in stems. This finding suggests that protein spot 34 might play an important role in soybean response to B. maydis. The staining intensity of protein spot 14 increased by 10-fold and that of protein spot 24 decreased by 6-fold in the nuclei of soybean stems. All 25 stem proteins were predicted in various important subcellular locations, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuole, chloroplast, and mitochondrion, which indicated that the response proteins might include proteins related to metabolism. Root proteins activate metabolic processes in response to B. maydis challenge on leaves We investigated the patterns of root protein expression in response to B. maydis challenge on leaves (Fig 3). Almost 1,000 proteins were detected in the CSS gel using PDQuest software 7.4, and all replicate gels showed highly similar distribution patterns in the 2-DE images. Around 25 proteins were differentially expressed (|ratio|≥2, P < 0.05). Overall analysis revealed that out of all the protein spots that matched in the treatment and control groups, 39% showed increased intensity and 61% presented a decrease in intensity. Twenty-three of these differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified in six functional groups, including proteins related to metabolic processes, cellular components, regulation of cellular processes, transmembrane transport, defense response, and molecular function (Table 3). These proteins were detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell wall, cell membrane, mitochondrion, and Golgi apparatus of root cells in response to a B. maydis challenge on leaves, which might contribute to the multiple NHR responses to non-adapted pathogens. Protein spots 1 and 19 were identified as elongation factor 1-delta-like (2.7-fold increase) and elongation factor 1-gamma-like (16.7-fold increase) proteins, which were predicted to localize to the mitochondrion and cytoplasm, respectively. This indicated that the metabolic processes related to protein synthesis in soybean roots might be different in response to B. maydis. Protein spot 25, which is a copper amino oxidase precursor, showed a significant increase in intensity (33.1-fold) in soybean root organs. Chalcone isomerase 4-like, proteasome subunit beta type-6-like, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1-like proteins are related to flavone and alcohol metabolic processes, showed an increase in spot intensity in response to B. maydis, which indicated that several proteins in the roots might be bifunctional under stress conditions. The spot intensities of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like and auxin-induced protein decreased, suggesting that the soybean root cells underwent a reduction in growth to increase its defense response to the infection. On the other hand, the intensity of protein spot 8, which is related to a protease, increased. This finding indicated that the protein degradation process also increased in response to B. maydis (Table 3). In summary, almost all of the plant cell organelles were predicted to respond to the B. maydis challenge on leaves, and the biological processes involved in growth and development were possibly bifunctional.

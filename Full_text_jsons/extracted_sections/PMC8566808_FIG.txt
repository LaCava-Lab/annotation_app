Expression levels of neutrophil activated proteins in sera/plasma of COVID-19 patients. Levels of (A) DEFA1, (B) S100A8/A9 and (C) MPO in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations in comparison to healthy controls. Figures D-F depict modulation of (D) DEFA1, (E) S100A8/A9 and (F) MPO levels in COVID-19 patients on different days post onset of disease (POD). The data is presented as dot plots with bar representing the mean ± SEM in each group. Each dot represents a single sample. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney test. * denotes p-value < 0.05, ** denotes p-value < 0.01, *** denotes p-value < 0.001 and **** denotes p-value < 0.0001. Expression levels of neutrophil activated proteins in sera/plasma of mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Figures A-C depict comparisons of levels of (A) DEFA1, (B) S100A8/A9 and (C) MPO among mild and severe disease patients at different PODs. Comparative levels of (D) DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO among severe disease patients at different days post onset of severity. The data is presented as dot plots with bar representing the mean ± SEM in each group. Each dot represents a single sample. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney test. ** denotes p-value < 0.01. (E) Expression levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients with mild disease at the time of admission (POD 2-14) and at follow-up (POD 8-21). (F) Expression levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients with severe disease at the time of admission (POD 5-14) and at follow-up (POD 7-19).The data are presented as line graphs with each line representing a single individual. P values were calculated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. * denotes p-value < 0.05, ** denotes p-value < 0.01. Expression levels of neutrophil activated proteins in severe COVID-19 patients in relation to occurrence of secondary infection and mechanical ventilation. Figure (A) depict comparative levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO in severe patients with or without secondary infection. The data is presented as dot plots with bar representing the mean ± SEM in each group. Each dot represents a single sample. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney test. Figures (B–D) depicts levels of (B) DEFA1, (C) S100A8/A9 and (D) MPO on different days before or after diagnosis of secondary infection. Each dot represents a single sample. The dotted line indicates cut-off value calculated as average value of expression levels of neutrophil activated proteins in healthy controls + 2*standard deviation. Comparative levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO among severe disease patients with (E) non-fatal and fatal disease outcome and (F) requiring mechanical ventilation. The data is presented as dot plots with bar representing the mean ± SEM in each group. Each dot represents a single sample. P values were calculated using Mann-Whitney test. * denotes p-value < 0.05, ** denotes p-value < 0.01. (G) Receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curve of DEFA1 serum levels for the prediction of COVID-19 disease severity among mild and severe disease presentations. Correlation analyses between levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 with clinical laboratory parameters in COVID-19 patients with severe disease at the time of admission. (A) DEFA1 levels compared with Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), C reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer levels. (B) Levels of S100A8/A9 compared with NLR, CRP and D-dimer levels. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was calculated for each graph.

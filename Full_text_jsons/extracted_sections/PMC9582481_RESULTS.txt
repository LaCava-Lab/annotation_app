Results 1. The expression of HLA-ABC in breast cancer cell lines treated with ICI or IFN-γ We evaluated the expression of the HLA-ABC protein in the ER-positive cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) and in an ER-negative cell line (MDA-MB-231) by Western blot analysis. The baseline HLA-ABC protein expression was higher in the MDA-MB-231 cell line than in the MCF-7 and T47D cell lines (Fig. 1A). Next, we treated the MCF-7 cells with 1 to 10 μM ICI, which is an ER downregulator, for 24 or 48 hours. The ER protein expression decreased and HLA-ABC increased with ICI treatment under all conditions (Fig. 1B). When the MCF-7 cells were treated with 100 units/mL of IFN-γ with or without 1 nM of estradiol for 48 hours, the HLA-ABC protein expression was markedly increased (Fig. 1C). 2. The expression of HLA-ABC in the ER-negative breast cancer cell line transfected with hESR-GFP We also observed changes in the HLA-ABC protein expression in the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cell line. Twenty-four or 48 hours after transfection with the hESR-GFP plasmid, the MDA-MB-231 cells showed ER expression and decreased HLA-ABC protein levels (Fig. 2A). When the MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 100 units/mL of IFN-γ with or without 1 nM of estradiol for 48 hours, HLA-ABC protein expression was markedly increased (Fig. 2B). 3. The change of HLA-A and MxA mRNA expressions in breast cancer cell lines in the GEO data We also analyzed the HLA-A and MxA mRNA expressions in breast cancer cells from the GEO database. When the MCF-7 cells were transfected with ESR1 shRNA, the ESR1 mRNA expression decreased, and the HLA-A and MxA mRNA expressions increased (Fig. 3). The fold changes were 0.360, 1.225, and 1.156 for ESR1, HLA-A, and MxA, respectively. 4. The changes of ER and HLA-ABC expressions, Ki-67 labeling index and TIL levels after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or estrogen modulators in breast cancer patients The clinicopathologic characteristics of the 126 patients who randomly received chemotherapy (adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) or estrogen modulator treatment (tamoxifen and goserelin) as their neoadjuvant systemic therapy and following surgical resection were analyzed (Table 1). Before the neoadjuvant therapy, there were no differences between the two groups in patient age, cT and cN categories, ER Allred score, Ki-67 labeling index, and TIL levels in biopsy specimens. After neoadjuvant therapy, no significant difference was observed in the pCR ratio (p=0.058). However, the chemotherapy group showed significantly lower ypT and ypN categories (p < 0.001 and p=0.016, respectively) and a more reduced tumor burden according to the Miller-Payne grade (p < 0.001). The estrogen modulator group showed more frequent lymphovascular invasion (p=0.046), a lower ER Allred score (p=0.027), higher Ki-67 labeling index (p=0.004) and higher TIL levels (p < 0.001) in resected specimens than the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (Figs. 4, 5). Next, we evaluated HLA-ABC expression in both the biopsy and resection tissues of 56 patients by immunohistochemistry (Table 1). Before neoadjuvant therapy, the HLA-ABC positivity in tumor cells did not differ significantly between the two groups (p=0.243). After neoadjuvant systemic therapy, however, the estrogen modulator group showed higher HLA-ABC positivity than the chemotherapy group (p=0.038). The overall survival and recurrence-free survival between the two groups did not differ significantly (p=0.396 and p=0.758, respectively) (S3 Fig.).

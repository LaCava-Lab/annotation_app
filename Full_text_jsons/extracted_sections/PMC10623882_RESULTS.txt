Results BRD4 is upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates breast CSC formation Initially, to determine the function of BRD4 in BCSCs, BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, was explored at breast CSC formation with the main focus on BC stemness. MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were treated with JQ1 for 24 h. JQ1 inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells at 40 µM (Fig. 1A). To examine a CSC-suppressing effect of the JQ1, a mammosphere formation assay was performed. JQ1 decreased the sphere size and the number of tumorspheres derived from MDA-MB-231 at 0.5 µM (Fig. 1B). The results indicated that JQ1 suppresses mammosphere formation. The CD44+/CD24− and ALDH-expressing populations represent breast CSC populations and use as breast CSC markers. MDA-MB-231 cancer cells were cultured with or without JQ1 for 24 h, and the CD44+/CD24− and ALDH-expressing subpopulations were determined. JQ1 decreased the CD44+/CD24− expressing subpopulation from 47 to 21.5% (Fig. 1C). JQ1-treated cells had reduced ALDH expression from 6.2 to 2% (Fig. 1D). To examine the expression levels of CSC-specific genes by JQ1 and the inhibitory effect of JQ1 on mammosphere proliferation through BRD4 inhibition, MDA-MB-231 cell and mammospheres were treated with JQ1. JQ1 inhibits Oct4, CD44, Sox2, and c-myc genes (Fig. 1E) and inhibited mammosphere proliferation (Fig. 1F). OCT4 and SOX2 protein expressions were reduced on JQ1 treatment (Fig. S4). To examine the effects of BRD4 on CSC formation, we checked the BRD4 levels of BCs and mammospheres. BRD4 is upregulated in breast CSCs derived from MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1G). siRNA silencing of BRD4 significantly reduced the mammosphere formation of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1H). The silencing of BRD4 of MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA of BRD4 decreased the CD44+/CD24−-expressing subpopulation from 65.4 to 48.9% (Fig. 1I) and ALDH-expressing population from 4.4 to 2.4% (Fig. 1J). ARV-825 is a PROTAC BRD4 inhibitor that recruits BRD4 to the E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to fast, efficient, and prolonged degradation of BRD4. We checked BRD4 function on breast CSC formation using ARV-825 and BRD4 proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader (Fig. 2A). ARV-825 degraded BRD4 protein and inhibited CSC formation at 0.1 µM concentration without cell death of BCs (Fig. 2B–D). The degradation of BRD4 of MDA-MB-231 cells with AVR-825 reduced the CD44+/CD24−-expressing subpopulation from 85.9 to 64.8% (Fig. 2E) and ALDH-expressing population from 4.3 to 1.4% (Fig. 2F). CSC-specific gene expression and mammosphere proliferation were assayed using ARV-825. The result represents that ARV-825 inhibits Oct4, CD44, Sox2, and c-myc (Fig. 2G) and inhibited mammosphere proliferation (Fig. 2H). BRD4 regulates the gene expression of PD-L1 and PD-L1 modulates breast CSC formation BET inhibitor, JQ-1, has shown suppression of PD-L1 expression levels in ovarian cancer and represents a treatment strategy for targeting PD-L1 expression. We checked PD-L1 and the effect of the BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825). The expressions of PD-L1 of BC cells and CSCs were analyzed, and they expressed PD-L1 (Fig. 3A). JQ1 and ARV825 decreased the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 (Fig. 3B, C). A previous paper showed that PD-L1 is located in the cellular membrane and nucleus through endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways. A research group reported that nuclear PD-L1 is independent of immune checkpoint function and inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth through sister chromatid cohesion of cancer cells. In addition, we confirmed that the morphology of the chromosome was changed when treated with verteporfin and siRNA of PD-L1 (Fig. S1). Our data show that JQ1 and ARV-825 reduced the total, membrane, cytoskeleton, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bond nuclear levels of PD-L1 protein (Fig. 3D, E). Initially, we checked the transcript levels of PD-L1 under BRD4 inhibitor and degrader treatment. The PD-L1-Luc reporter assay showed that JQ1 and ARV825 inhibit PD-L1 promoter activity based on the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3F) and suppressed the BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter by BRD4-ChIP assay (Figs. 3G and S2). BRD4 inhibition and degradation inhibit promoter activity and BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter. To examine the effects of PD-L1 on CSC formation, we checked CSC formation through siRNA-mediated silencing PD-L1. The siRNA of PD-L1 inhibits the formation of breast CSCs derived from MDA-MB-231 cancer cells (Fig. 3H). We found that nuclear PD-L1 regulates breast CSC formation. Nuclear PD-L1 modulated breast CSC formation through the regulation of the RelB gene Nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expression of NF-κB signaling (BIRC3, RelB, and TRAP1), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B, and HLA-H), and immune checkpoint (PD-L2, VISTA, and B&-H3). The NF-κB pathway is a crucial factor in CSC formation and therapeutic target. As verteporfin decreases the intrinsic and interferon-induced PD-L1 expressions of six cancer cell lines, we checked the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 under verteporfin treatment. Verteporfin reduced the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 at 2 µM Fig. 4A). As nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expression of RelB and the NF-κB pathway is a crucial factor of CSC formation, we checked the transcript and protein levels of RelB under verteporfin treatment. Verteporfin reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB at the same concentration that reduced PD-L1 (Fig. 4B). To investigate the function of RelB in breast CSC formation, we used BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (RV825). JQ1 and ARV825 reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB (Fig. 4C). We investigated RelB function on CSC formation through RelB silencing. The siRNA-mediated silencing of RelB inhibits the formation of breast CSCs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4D). We used RelB inhibitor, 1α, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Calcitriol reduced the protein levels of RelB and inhibits cell proliferation at 20 µM and mammosphere formation at 25 µM (Fig. 4E). Our data show that RelB regulates breast CSC formation. RelB binds with p65 and RelB/p65 complex regulated transcripts and secretory IL6 RelB/p65 (RelA) complex promotes NF-κB target genes such as TNF and IL-6 in ER-negative BC. We examined the interaction of RelB and p65 to understand the CSC regulation of RelB. Figure 5 A shows that RelB and p65 (RelA) interact with each other. The downregulation of p65 using siRNA of p65 reduced the mammosphere formation of BC (Fig. 5B). We used caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) to investigate CSC regulation by nuclear p65 activity. CAPE has strong inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation through the inhibition of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. We assayed cell proliferation, mammosphere formation, and nuclear localization of p65 using CAPE (Fig. 5C). Our results showed that CAPE did not change cell proliferation, but inhibited mammosphere formation and nuclear localization of p65. CSC formation is regulated by the nuclear location of p65, the NF-κB component. Cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, regulated by NF-κB proteins regulated breast CSC population. The levels of CSC-regulating cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were examined under a BRD4 inhibitor, PD-L1 inhibitor, RelB inhibitor, and p65 inhibitor treatments. The RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) and p65 inhibitor (CAPE) only inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig. 6A). The BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and PD-L1 inhibitor (verteporfin) also inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig. 6B, C). Then, we performed the ChIP assay to identify RelB and p65 binding of the IL-6 promoter using a PCR primer set spanning the IL-6 promoter (Figs. 6D and S3). RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) endogenously reduced the IL-6 promoter binding affinity of RelB and p65. The IL-6 gene of breast CSCs is regulated by RelB and p65 protein through the binding of the IL-6 promoter. Secretory IL-6 and IL-8 play essential roles in mammosphere formation. To assess the production of secretory IL-6 and IL-8, we performed a human inflammatory cytokine assay on mammosphere-cultured broth using cytokine assay beads. The human inflammatory cytokine data indicated that inhibitors only reduce the production of secretory IL-6, not IL-8 (Fig. 6E). We performed the rescue experiments using the PD-L1 overexpression plasmid to understand the role of the existence of the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis in breast CSCs. For the rescue of BRD4-dependent PD-L1 degradation, the PD-L1_GFP expression vector was transfection into breast cancer cells with/without ARV-825 (BRD4 degrader). BRD4 degrader reduced BRD4, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels and overexpression of PD-L1 of ARV-825 treated breast cancers increased reduced PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels (Fig. 6F). Our experiments showed the existence of the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 in breast CSCs. Natural product, THF, and BRD4 inhibitor inhibit CSC formation through the downregulation of the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis THF is a natural product found in Acacia confuse. THF was known as a novel and potent selective BRD4 inhibitor. To find a natural compound for targeting breast CSCs, we selected THF, a BRD4 inhibitor (Fig. 7A). THF inhibits cell proliferation at 200 µM and mammosphere formation at 100 µM (Fig. 7B, C). THF downregulates not only c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB in whole cells (Fig. 7D) but also the nuclear protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB (Fig. 7E). THF reduced the transcripts (Fig. 7F) and secretory IL-6 (Fig. 7G). We have examined the effect of a selective BRD4 inhibitor for targeting breast CSCs using the TNBC line HCC1937. ARV-825, BRD4 degrader inhibited CSCs formation at 0.1 µM concentration without cell death of BCs (Fig. 7H, I). HCC1937 cells with ARV-825 reduced the ALDH-expressing population from 1.2 to 0.4% (Fig. 7J). To confirm the biochemical function of ARV-825 on HCC1937 cells, we analyzed the levels of BRD4, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6. ARV-825 reduced total protein levels of BRD4, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 in mammospheres derived from HCC1937 cells (Fig. 7K, L). Our data showed that BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis regulates breast CSC formation and our suggestion was confirmed by THF and ARV-825. Functional assay of THF as an anti-CSC agent using MC-38 murine colon carcinoma cells The MC-38 cell line derived from C57BL/6 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells can be employed as it has expressed PD-L1 and secretory IL-6. We confirmed THF as an anti-CSC agent using MC-38 murine colon carcinoma cells. THF inhibits cell proliferation at 100 µM and tumorsphere formation at 200 µM (Fig. 8A, B). As ALDH1 is a colon CSC marker, we checked the ALDH1 levels of MC-38 under THF treatment. This compound reduced the ALDH1 activity of the MC-38 subpopulation and induced the apoptosis of tumorspheres derived from MC-38 colon cancer cells (Fig. 8C, D). To confirm the biochemical function of THF on MC-38 cells, we analyzed the levels of c-myc, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6. Our data showed that THF reduced total protein levels of c-myc, PD-L1, and RelB and decreased nuclear protein levels of c-myc, PD-L1, and RelB on tumorspheres derived from MC-38 cells (Fig. 8E, F). As THF reduced secretory IL-6 levels (Fig. 8G), THF reduced colon CSC formation through the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis. Antitumor effect of THF using MC38 syngeneic xenograft model The MC-38 cell line derived from C57BL/6 murine colon adenocarcinoma cells and 4T1 cell line from BALB/c murine breast cancer can be employed as a robust preclinical immuno-oncology model and expressed PD-L1 and secretory IL-6. 4T1 and MC-38 cells were used to evaluate methods of disrupting tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) inhibitors and investigate methods of improving immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy (such as PD-L1 blockade). As THF has an anti-proliferative effect on MC-38 cells, we used an in vivo mouse model to examine whether it reduces tumor growth (Fig. 9A and Fig. S5A). The body weights of the control and THF-treated C57BL/6 and BALB/c murine mice did not change (Fig. 9B and Fig. S5B). The weights and volume of tumors from THF-treated C57BL/6 and THF-treated BALB/c murine were lower and small than those of tumors from control C57BL/6 and BALB/c murine (Fig. 9B and Fig. S5B). To demonstrate the effect of THF on MC-38 and 4T1 tumor in vivo, we performed Western blotting of the resected tumor tissue. Reduced expressions of c-myc, PD-L1, and RelB proteins were observed in THF-treated MC38 tumor tissues compared with the control group (Fig. 9C and Fig. S5C). Our results indicated that THF effectively reduced tumor growth. We isolated 4T1-derived and MC38-derived tumor and TDLNs using Evans blue staining and checked the colon CSC marker, ALDH1, using the ALDEFLOUR™ assay. THF reduced the ALDH1-positive subpopulation from 2.4 to 1.6% in the MC-38 colon tumor and 1.1–0.2% in the 4T1 breast tumor (Fig. 9D and Fig. S5D) and the ALDH-expressing population from 2.2 to 0.2% and 0.8–0.2% in TDLN (Fig. 9E and Fig. S5D). These results showed that THF reduced the frequency of ALDH1-expressing subpopulations of tumor and TDLNs and the colon CSC trait. THF increased the levels of CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and TDLNs of the MC-38 and 4T1 tumor bearing mice (Fig. 9F, G and Fig.S5E).

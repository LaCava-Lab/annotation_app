Results Glucocorticoids increase Kv2.2 currents in HEK293 cells To investigate the rapid non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids, we examined whether glucocorticoids could regulate the activity of Kv2.2 channels. Rat Kv2.2 channels were overexpressed in HEK293 cells and the Kv2.2 currents induced by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV. Extracellular application of cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, rapidly increased the Kv2.2 currents in a concentration-dependent manner within 5 min, suggesting a rapid non-genomic effect (Ctrl, normalized, with 0.1% DMSO: 100 ± 2.1%; n = 6; 0.1 μM: 113.2 ± 2.7%; n = 6; p = 0.1669; 1 μM: 123.4 ± 4.7%; n = 6; p = 0.0011; 10 μM: 135.8 ± 4.4%; n = 7; p < 0.0001; 50 μM: 140.8 ± 2.7%; n = 6; p < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 1A–C). The increase in Kv2.2 current reached a plateau in the presence of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution (10 μM Vs 50 μM: p > 0.9999; Fig. 1C); therefore, we used 10 μM cortisol for the subsequent experiments unless noted otherwise. Since the primary glucocorticoid in rats and mice is corticosterone, we also investigated whether cortisol and corticosterone exert similar effects. Extracellular application of 10 μM corticosterone induced a similar stimulatory effect on Kv2.2 currents to that of cortisol (126.1 ± 2.2%; n = 5; p = 0.0129, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1D). To verify that the stimulatory effect of cortisol acted on Kv2.2 channels instead of other possible endogenous potassium channels in HEK293 cells, we selectively inhibited the Kv2.2 channels via intracellular application of Kv2.2-specific antibody (1:200) in the pipette solution using a whole-cell configuration. Approximately 1–2 min after break-in, Kv2.2-specific antibody dramatically reduced the IK, and cortisol showed no effect on residual currents (Ctrl: n = 5; Anti-Kv2.2: 22.8 ± 4.5%; n = 5; p = 0.0003; Anti-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 20.3 ± 3.2%; n = 5; p = 0.0003; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 1E). We also tested the specificity of the Kv2.2 antibody in HEK293 cells overexpressing Kv2.1. The Kv2.2 antibody had no effect on Kv2.1 current (Ctrl: n = 6; Anti-Kv2.2: 96.0 ± 1.9%; n = 6; p = 0.1294; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1F). In addition, the Kv2.1-specific antibody in the pipette solution did not alter the Kv2.2 currents or the stimulatory effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 currents (Ctrl: n = 5; Anti-Kv2.1: 98.6 ± 2.7%; n = 5; p > 0.9999; Anti-Kv2.1 + cortisol: 128.8 ± 2.6%; n = 5; p = 0.0003; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 1G). We further examined whether cortisol increased Kv2.2 currents by altering the steady-state activation or inactivation properties of Kv2.2 currents. We plotted the current-voltage (I-V) curve induced by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 mV to −70, −60, …+40 mV with an interval of 10 s in the presence of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution (Fig. 1H, left). We found that cortisol increased Kv2.2 currents at all depolarization pulses that were more positive than 0 mV (n = 5 for each group; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1H, right). However, cortisol did not change either the steady-state activation (Ctrl: V1/2 = 6.4 ± 2.7 mV; Cortisol: V1/2 = 8.3 ± 2.5 mV; n = 7; p = 0.6443, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1I) or inactivation (Ctrl: V1/2 = 12.0 ± 1.2 mV; Cortisol: V1/2 = 9.7 ± 2.5 mV; n = 5; p = 0.4519, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1J) properties of Kv2.2 currents. To further investigate the mechanism of the cortisol-induced activation of Kv2.2 channels, we examined the Kv2.2 single-channel activity using cell-attached recording. We found that cortisol significantly increased the channel open probability from 33.5 ± 5.5% to 50.9 ± 8.7% (n = 7; p = 0. 0162, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 1K and L) without affecting the single-channel conductance (Fig. 1M). Glucocorticoids increase Kv2.2 currents through the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors Non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids can be glucocorticoid receptor-dependent or -independent. Next, we investigated whether cortisol increases Kv2.2 currents via glucocorticoid receptors. We found that 1 μM dexamethasone, the artificial synthetic cortisol analog, could significantly increase the Kv2.2 currents induced by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV in HEK293 cells (131.5 ± 4.4%; n = 7; p = 0.0019, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2A). Bath application of RU486 (10 μM), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, completely abolished the cortisol-induced increase in Kv2.2 currents (102.5 ± 3.0%; n = 9; p = 0.2926, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2B). In addition, RU486 itself had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (n = 7; p = 0.6082, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2C). These results suggest that cortisol increases the Kv2.2 current via the glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathway. The glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to be expressed both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, raising the question of which receptors are responsible for the non-genomic effects of cortisol. Previous studies have indicated that the non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids are most likely mediated via the glucocorticoid receptors on the cell membrane. To test this hypothesis, we applied 1 μM BSA-conjugated dexamethasone, a membrane-impermeable agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, to the extracellular solution and found a similar increase in Kv2.2 currents compared to the dexamethasone-treated group (136.0 ± 4.2% of the control group; n = 7; p = 0.0025, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2D). Moreover, we applied 10 μM RU486 to the bath solution and found that it blocked the increase in Kv2.2 current induced by dexamethasone-BSA (95.9 ± 2.9% compared with RU486 group, n = 10; p = 0.2333, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2E), suggesting a dominant role of the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor in modulating the glucocorticoid-increased Kv2.2 currents. Glucocorticoids increase Kv2.2 currents via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway Previous studies have reported that cortisol exerts its effects via several signaling pathways downstream of the glucocorticoid receptors, including the PKA, PKC, and ERK signaling pathways. First, we used staurosporine, a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor, to test whether the stimulatory effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 occurs through protein kinase signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 2F, staurosporine abolished the stimulatory effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 (93.8 ± 5.0% compared with the staurosporine-treated group; n = 6; p = 0.4994, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 2F). To further determine the protein kinase signaling pathway through which cortisol facilitates Kv2.2 currents, we applied H-89 (10 μM, the PKA antagonist), Bis (1 μM, the PKC antagonist), and U0126 (10 μM, the ERK antagonist) to the extracellular solution to inhibit the three kinases. We found that neither H-89 nor Bis could suppress the cortisol-induced increase in the Kv2.2 currents (H-89: 126.1 ± 6.0%; n = 5; p = 0.0111, paired Student's t-test; BIS: 122.4 ± 2.2%; n = 5; p = 0.0273, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2G and H). However, 10 μM U0126 completely abolished the cortisol-facilitated Kv2.2 current (104.5 ± 4.0%; n = 8; p = 0.3366, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2I), suggesting that cortisol increases the Kv2.2 current via the ERK signaling pathway. Acutely application of H-89, Bis or U0126 had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (Fig. 2J). We further examined whether the ERK kinase was activated by cortisol in Western blot experiments. Five-minute treatment with 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells (144.4 ± 13.4%; n = 5; p = 0.030; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2K). Therefore, we concluded that cortisol increased the Kv2.2 currents via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Glucocorticoids increase native Kv2.2 currents in cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses After demonstrating the non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids in HEK293 cells that overexpress Kv2.2 channels, we considered the differences between the HEK293 cell line and brain neurons. We investigated the rapid non-genomic effects of cortisol on native Kv2.2 channels in brain slices. We examined the effect of cortisol in mouse cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons and the rat giant calyx-type synapses located in the brain stem, where Kv2.2 channels have been reported to be preferentially expressed. In cortical pyramidal neurons, we elicited the IK using a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV. Bath application of 10 μM cortisol for 5 min significantly increased the rectified outward IK by 28.0 ± 1.2% (Ctrl: 1.8 ± 0.3 nA; Cortisol: 2.3 ± 0.4 nA; n = 5; p = 0.0036, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3A). Corticosterone had a similar effect on the IK in the pyramidal neurons to that of cortisol (n = 8; p = 0.0009, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3B). Moreover, in the presence of corticosterone, additional treatment with cortisol did not further increase the IK currents (Fig. 3B), indicating that the effects of cortisone and cortisol on the potassium channel currents are mediated through the same signaling pathway. To determine whether the cortisol-increased IK in the pyramidal neurons was mediated by Kv2.2 channels, we selectively inhibited the Kv2.2 channels via intracellular application of Kv2.2-specific antibody in the pipette solution using a whole-cell configuration. Approximately 1–2 min after break-in, Kv2.2-specific antibody dramatically reduced the IK by 51.6 ± 4.9% (Ctrl: 2.3 ± 0.3 nA; Anti-Kv2.2: 1.2 ± 0.2 nA; n = 5; p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), and additional application of 10 μM cortisol to the extracellular solution for 5 min could no longer increase the IK (88.3 ± 11.8% compared to the IK with Kv2.2 antibody; n = 5; p = 0.4311, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), confirming that Kv2.2 plays a dominant role in mediating the cortisol-induced increase in the potassium current in cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons. To further confirm the involvement of Kv2.2 channels in the cortisol-induced increase of IK, we used lentivirus vectors to deliver shRNA targeted to affect post-translational silencing of the Kv2.2 gene in the pyramidal neurons. First, the knockdown efficiency of the shRNA was tested in HEK293 cells overexpressing Kv2.2 (KD-Kv2.2: 39.2 ± 2.5%; n = 3; p = 0.0017, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, left). The shRNA targeting Kv2.2 channels reduced IK by 62.3% in the pyramidal neurons (Scramble: 2.6 ± 0.3 nA; n = 4; KD-Kv2.2: 1.0 ± 0.3 nA; n = 6; p = 0.0016, unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, right). The knockdown of Kv2.2 channels mimicked Kv2.2 antibody-induced inhibition of the cortisol-induced increase in Kv2.2 currents (KD-Kv2.2: 1.1 ± 0.2 nA; n = 6; KD-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 1.1 ± 0.2 nA; n = 6; p = 0.7077, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3E). Similar to our observations in HEK293 cells above, RU486 (10 μM) or U0126 (10 μM) abolished the cortisol-induced increase in IK in the cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor and ERK1/2 signaling pathway, respectively (RU486 + cortisol compared to the IK with RU486: 104.3 ± 2.4%; n = 8; p = 0.1212, paired Student's t-test; U0126 + cortisol compared to the IK with U0126: 96.9 ± 1.6%; n = 8; p = 0.1471, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3F and G). Western blots experiment further demonstrated that cortisol increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinase in cortical pyramidal neurons (131.8 ± 3.2%; n = 4; p = 0.0023, unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. 3H), indicating that cortisol increases the native Kv2.2 channel currents via the glucocorticoid receptor/ERK signaling pathway in cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons. The calyx of Held synapse contains a giant presynaptic nerve terminal that allows direct presynaptic and postsynaptic recordings to investigate the precise mechanisms of synaptic transmission. Consistent with our results in cortical pyramidal neurons, 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution also dramatically increased the presynaptic IK induced by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV (Ctrl: 3.0 ± 0.2 nA; cortisol: 3.5 ± 0.2 nA; n = 9; p = 0.0011, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 4A) in the presynaptic nerve terminals of the calyx of Held synapse. Furthermore, corticosterone had a similar stimulatory effect to that of cortisol in the calyces (n = 8; p = 0.0451, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 4B). Kv2.2-specific antibody (1:200 in the pipette solution) reduced the IK by 20% approximately 3 min after break-in (19.0 ± 2.2%; n = 8; p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 4C), and cortisol could no longer increase the IK (98.4 ± 0.8% compared to the IK with Kv2.2 antibody; n = 8; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 4C), confirming that the cortisol-induced increase in the presynaptic IK was mediated by the Kv2.2 channels at the calyx of Held synapse. RU486 (10 μM) or U0126 (10 μM) completely abolished the cortisol-increased Kv2.2 current (RU486 + cortisol compared to the IK with RU486: 100.9 ± 1.5%; n = 9; p = 0.4853, paired Student's t-test; U0126 + cortisol compared to the IK with U0126: 99.6 ± 3.5%; n = 8; p = 0.6979, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 4D and E), confirming that it is the same signaling pathway as that in cortical pyramidal neurons. Glucocorticoids inhibit neuronal excitability via Kv2.2 channels in cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses The Kv2 channel family has been shown to play key roles in regulating neuronal excitability by regulating AP repolarization and hyperpolarizing inter-spike membrane potentials during repetitive firing. Therefore, we further explored how cortisol modulated the neuronal excitability in cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses by examining the AP firing pattern. In cortical pyramidal neurons, repetitive AP firings were elicited by the injection of a 1 s, 200-pA current via a whole-cell configuration. Adding 10 μM cortisol to the extracellular solution significantly reduced the AP frequency by 34.7 ± 8.0% (Ctrl: 17.6 ± 1.5 Hz; Cortisol: 11.5 ± 1.9 Hz; n = 8; p = 0.0134; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 5A and B). Cortisol did not affect the resting membrane potential (Ctrl: −74.6 ± 2.4 mV; Cortisol: −75.7 ± 2.7 mV; n = 8; p = 0.3829; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 5C), AP amplitude (Ctrl: 92.6 ± 1.8 mV; Cortisol: 91.6 ± 2.6 mV; n = 8; p = 0.5276, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 5D), or half-width (Ctrl: 2.6 ± 0.1 ms; Cortisol: 2.6 ± 0.2 ms; n = 8; p = 0.9696, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 5E). These results suggested that cortisol inhibits AP firing but does not affect the characteristics of the AP waveform in cortical neurons. We further applied the Kv2.2 antibody (1:200) via the pipette solution and found that cortisol could not reduce the AP frequency (Kv2.2 antibody: 12.4 ± 1.7 Hz; Kv2.2 antibody + cortisol: 11.2 ± 1.7 Hz; n = 5; p = 0.2835, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 5F and G), indicating that Kv2.2 played a pivotal role in mediating the AP firing. At the calyx-type synapse, we induced single AP at the presynaptic nerve terminal by injecting 1 ms, 100–300 pA current in the current clamp configuration (Fig. 6A). Administration of cortisol (10 μM) to the extracellular solution did not affect the resting membrane potential (Ctrl: −68.2 ± 1.4 mV, Cortisol: −69.4 ± 1.8 mV; n = 9; p = 0.3237, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6B), and we did not observe significant differences in AP amplitude (Ctrl: 106.3 ± 1.3 mV, Cortisol: 106.8 ± 1.6 mV; n = 9; p = 0.7847, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6C) or half-width (Ctrl: 0.54 ± 0.03 ms, Cortisol: 0.62 ± 0.06 ms; n = 9; p = 0.2733, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6D) after bath application of cortisol for 5 min. We also induced repetitive AP firing by injecting a 1s, 300 pA current (Fig. 6E). Cortisol significantly reduced the AP frequency at the presynaptic nerve terminal (Ctrl: 15.0 ± 4.8 Hz; Cortisol: 6.4 ± 2.5 Hz; n = 7; p = 0.0167, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6F, top), consistent with what we have seen in the cortical pyramidal neurons. We also compared the bursting firing frequency and found that cortisol also significantly reduced the bursting frequency (Ctrl: 4.9 ± 1.4 Hz; Cortisol: 2.0 ± 0.8 Hz; n = 7; p = 0.0437, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6F, bottom). Intracellular application of Kv2.2 antibody (1:200) via the pipette solution decreased the AP frequency (Ctrl: 13.9 ± 2.4 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2: 10.1 ± 1.8 Hz; n = 8; p = 0.0221, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6G and H, top), and additional application of 10 μM cortisol to the extracellular solution could not further reduce the frequency (Anti-Kv2.2: 10.1 ± 1.8 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 9.1 ± 1.6 Hz; n = 8; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6H, top). Kv2.2 antibody also reduced the bursting firing frequency (Ctrl: 4.5 ± 1.7 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2: 2.3 ± 0.9 Hz; n = 8; p = 0.0029, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6H, bottom) and abolished the effect of cortisol (Anti-Kv2.2: 2.3 ± 0.9 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 2.4 ± 0.9 Hz; n = 8; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6H, bottom), confirming the involvement of the Kv2.2 channels. At calyces, the neuronal firing can be increased to 600 Hz upon stimulation. Therefore, we induced 1 s AP firing by 1 ms, 300 pA depolarizing current injections at 10, 50, 100, and 200 Hz. We found that the APs at the nerve terminal were 100% successful at 10 Hz, and cortisol could not reduce the successful rate (Fig. 6I, top left). However, at higher stimulation frequencies, cortisol gradually inhibited the AP success rate in a frequency-dependent manner (50 Hz: Ctrl, 69 ± 13%; Cortisol, 66 ± 14%; n = 5; p = 0.3739, paired Student's t-test; 100 Hz: Ctrl, 51 ± 13%; Cortisol, 32 ± 12%; n = 5; p = 0.0025, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 26 ± 5%; Cortisol, 13 ± 6%; n = 5; p = 0.0328, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6I and J). In addition, Kv2.2 antibody (1:200) in the pipette solution abolished the cortisol-induced inhibition of the AP successful rate at all stimulation frequencies (50 Hz: Ctrl, 70 ± 15%; Cortisol, 62 ± 17%; n = 5; p = 0.4630, paired Student's t-test; 100 Hz: Ctrl, 47 ± 15%; Cortisol, 46 ± 16%; n = 5; p = 0.7151, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 11 ± 3%; Cortisol, 8 ± 2%; n = 5; p = 0.0793, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6K and L). These results demonstrated that cortisol can inhibit neuronal excitability upon intense stimulation. Glucocorticoids inhibit synaptic transmission upon intense stimulation at calyx-type synapses Presynaptic AP triggers neurotransmitter release and evokes the postsynaptic response. We further investigated whether the cortisol-induced presynaptic inhibition affects the postsynaptic responses at the calyx-type synapse. We elicited two consecutive EPSCs at the principal neuron via a pair of brief stimulations with a bipolar electrode every 10 s. Bicuculline (10 μM) was added to the extracellular solution to inhibit GABAA-mediated currents. PPR was used to evaluate the changes in release probability. After 5 min baseline recording, cortisol (10 μM) was applied to the extracellular solution for 15 min, and then washed out for another 10 min (Fig. 7A). We found that the EPSC amplitude, PPR, rise time, and decay time were not significantly changed with cortisol treatment, suggesting that cortisol did not affect either the characteristics of the postsynaptic responses or the presynaptic release probability (Fig. 7B–D). We also measured the mEPSCs to examine whether cortisol can modulate the sensitivity of the postsynaptic AMPA receptors (Fig. 7E). All mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV with 50 μM APV and 10 μM bicuculline in the extracellular solution to inhibit the NMDA and GABAA-receptors mediated currents. The mean mEPSC amplitude and frequency in controls were 32.1 ± 1.8 pA and 1.2 ± 0.3 Hz, respectively (2528 events from 7 calyces; Fig. 7F and G). The 10–90% rise time and 20–80% decay time were 0.34 ± 0.02 ms and 1.69 ± 0.08 ms, respectively (n = 7; Fig. 7I and J). Administration of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution did not change the amplitude (32.7 ± 2.0 pA, 2112 events from 7 calyces, p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7F) or frequency (1.0 ± 0.2 Hz; p = 0.3467; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7G). The 10–90% rise time and 20–80% decay time were also not affected (Cortisol-treated group: 10–90% rise time, 0.32 ± 0.02 ms; 20–80% decay time,1.66 ± 0.07 ms; n = 7; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7I and J). The results of the EPSC and mEPSC recordings were consistent with the observation that cortisol did not affect the presynaptic AP firing at low frequency (Fig. 6). We further explored how EPSCs were affected under intense stimulation. We evoked 40 EPSCs at 5, 50, 100, and 200 Hz at the postsynaptic principal neuron via fiber stimulation in the presence of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution. Cortisol induced an increased activity-dependent synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation trains. The success rate was dramatically decreased when the stimulation frequency was higher than 100 Hz (100 Hz: Ctrl, 97.1 ± 1.4%; Cortisol, 98.3 ± 1.1%; n = 6; p = 0.0756, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 52.1 ± 5.0%; Cortisol, 33.8 ± 4.4%; n = 6; p = 0.0011, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 7K and L). The EPSC40/EPSC1 ratio was also decreased (100 Hz: Ctrl, 6.3 ± 2.0%; Cortisol, 5.3 ± 2.1%; n = 6; p = 0.1942, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 4.5 ± 1.6%; Cortisol, 1.7 ± 0.6%; n = 6; p = 0.0450, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 7K and L). These results indicated that cortisol strongly enhanced the synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation.

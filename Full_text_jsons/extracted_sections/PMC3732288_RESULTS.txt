Results Characterization of endothelial and stromal cell cultures BM MNCs were isolated from central marrow or endosteal marrow, and grown in either endothelial or stromal cell culture conditions. ECs from the spleen were also cultured as a comparison with the BM derived ECs. In these experiments, the five types of cultured cells; central marrow derived ECs, endosteal marrow derived ECs, spleen derived ECs, central marrow derived SCs and endosteal marrow derived SCs, were characterized for endothelial specific markers. The cells in endothelial culture conditions presented typical endothelial cobblestone morphology after reaching confluence, while the cells in the stromal culture conditions showed spindle-shape cells and lacked the cobblestone morphology (data not shown). The mRNA expression level of endothelial related genes, Tie-2 and VE-cadherin, were significantly higher in the central marrow derived ECs and spleen ECs, while the expression in endosteal marrow ECs was only marginally greater than either stromal cell culture (Figure 1A, B). To further examine the endothelial phenotype, endothelial specific markers including CD31 and VE-cadherin were evaluated in the cultured cells by fluorescence immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Cells grown in all EC culture conditions expressed CD31 and VE-cadherin, but the central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs did not (Figure 1C). The percentage of expression of CD31 or VE-cadherin in the ECs was about 40%–50%. When the ECs were detached from the culture flasks using a cell dissociation solution treatment instead of the trypsin-EDTA, a much higher level of ECs was detected in EC cultures derived from central marrow, endosteal marrow and spleen as compared to central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 1D). The cells in the ECs culture condition also had the ability to take up DiI-Ac-LDL and form capillary-like tubes in Matrigel. To evaluate the composition of non-endothelial cells in the stromal and endothelial culture conditions, we assessed the level of osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are one of the components of primary bone marrow stromal cells, and characterized by the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity. We observed no, or very few, ALP+ cells in the central marrow and spleen derived ECs cultures. However, the cells in the endosteal marrow derived ECs culture condition contained about 10% ALP positive cells. The higher proportion of ALP+ cells (40%–50%) were observed in the central marrow and endosteal marrow derived SCs culture condition as compared to the cells in the ECs culture condition (Figure 1E). Therefore, highly EC enriched primary cultures were used in these experiments. Central marrow ECs demonstrated enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cells We next assessed the ability of the five types of cultured cells to maintain primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro using the functional CAFC assay. The CAFC frequency at shorter (days 14) and longer (days 28–49) time intervals was used to measure relatively mature and primitive hematopoietic cells, respectively. As shown in Figure 2A, the frequencies of short-term (day 14) and long-term (day 35) CAFCs of BM MNCs on central marrow EC and endosteal marrow EC were higher compared with those on spleen EC, central marrow SC or endosteal marrow SC. The CAFC frequencies of BM MNCs on central marrow EC and endosteal marrow EC from day 14 to day 35 were similar, but these two curves diverged at culture times after day 35. On day 49 of culture, CAFCs were detectable only on central marrow ECs. We further compared the effects of central marrow ECs and central marrow SCs to support the primitive hematopoietic cell activity of purified lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells. The CAFC activity in the LSK cells subpopulation on the central marrow ECs were significantly higher than that on the central marrow SCs at day 14 and day 35 (Figure 2B). These data indicate that central marrow or endosteal marrow derived ECs have enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cell growth over spleen derived ECs and BM derived SCs. In addition, central marrow ECs are capable of maintaining primitive hematopoietic cell activity for longer time intervals over the other supportive layers. In order to determine the effect of the five types of cultured cells on the proliferation and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells, we measured the number of CD45+ hematopoietic cells and CFU-C activity, following a 7 day co-culture of LSK cells. We found that the central marrow ECs could promote the proliferation of CD45+ hematopoietic cells by 2 to 15 fold higher than other types of supportive cells (Figure 2C). In addition, the generation of CFU-Cs on central marrow ECs was significantly higher than that on other supportive layers (Figure 2D). These results demonstrated that central marrow ECs are superior in their ability of promoting proliferation and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells than other feeder layers. Interestingly, spleen ECs were able to support the proliferation and differentiation of the primitive hematopoietic cells (Figure 2C, D), but were not able to support more primitive CAFCs (Figure 2A). PlGF expression is specifically higher in the central marrow ECs Recent studies have suggested that VEGF-A and PlGF may be important cytokines involved in the reciprocal interaction between primitive hematopoietic cells and ECs. Therefore, we postulated that VEGF-family factors secreted from ECs may act upon the primitive hematopoietic cells to regulate their physiology. To examine the mechanism of enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cells by the central marrow ECs, we performed real-time PCR analysis for the expression of VEGFa, VEGFb and PlGF. The five types of cultured cells expressed VEGFa at very similar levels (Figure 3B). VEGFb expression in cultured central marrow ECs was higher than cultured endosteal marrow ECs, cultured central marrow SCs and cultured endosteal marrow SCs, but the expression was similar to cultured spleen ECs (Figure 3C). In contrast, the expression of PlGF was significantly higher specifically in the cultured central marrow ECs compared with the other types of cultured cells (Figure 3D). In addition, we examined the expression of VEGFa, VEGFb and PlGF in freshly isolated central marrow ECs, endosteal marrow ECs, spleen ECs, central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3A). Albeit at a much lower level, in contrast to the cultured cells, VEGFa expression in freshly sorted ECs derived from central marrow, spleen and endosteal marrow was higher than the central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3B), whereas the expression of VEGFb in freshly sorted ECs and SCs was similar (Figure 3C). However, correlating with the cultured cells, the expression of PlGF in the freshly sorted central marrow ECs and endosteal marrow ECs was higher than the spleen ECs, central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3D). These results suggest that PlGF was predominantly expressed on endothelial cells but not on stromal cells in the mouse BM. Therefore, due to this high expression in the cultured central marrow ECs, we hypothesized that PlGF may mediate the supportive role of these cells on primitive hematopoietic cells. Reduced PlGF expression in central marrow ECs diminishes their ability to support primitive hematopoietic cells To determine whether the increased expression of PlGF plays a functional role in the support of the primitive hematopoietic cells, we used a genetic ‘knockdown’ approach to reduce PlGF gene expression in the cultured central marrow ECs. Anti-PlGF shRNA vectors were transduced into central marrow ECs and PlGF expression was quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that among five different shRNA vectors, E8 and E12, as well as their combination, significantly reduced PlGF expression compared to control cells (Figure 4A). To exclude the possibility that reduction of PlGF grossly altered the properties of the ECs, we examined the characteristics of ECs before and after PlGF knockdown. We found that PlGF knockdown central marrow EC took up Ac-LDL uniformly as well as non-transduced central marrow EC (Figure 4B). Additionally, PlGF knockdown central marrow EC formed capillary-like tubules within 5–16 hours when plated on Matrigel (Figure 4C). Analysis of the average length of the endothelial tubules demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the control and the PlGF knockdown cells (278 μm +/−50 µm versus 267 μm +/−94 μm, respectively). These results demonstrated that PlGF knockdown central marrow EC retained endothelial characteristics. To directly evaluate the ability of these cells to support primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro, LSK cells were seeded on central marrow ECs transduced with E8, E12 and E8+E12. We found that there was an significant inhibition of long term (day 35) CAFCs activity on PlGF shRNA transduced central marrow ECs compared with the mock transduced central marrow ECs and non-transduced central marrow ECs (Figure 4D). These results suggested that PlGF is involved in the supportive effect of central marrow ECs on primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro. Knockdown of PlGF expression in central marrow ECs inhibits recovery of primitive hematopoietic cells in vivo  Previous studies have demonstrated that following sub-lethal irradiation, mice injected with murine fetal blood ECs displayed accelerated recovery of hematopoiesis with essentially normal BM sinusoid vessel architecture recovery by day 20 following irradiation. To investigate whether PlGF is involved in this process, we transplanted central marrow ECs, PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs, central marrow SCs or PBS into Balb/c mice that were irradiated with 550cGy and evaluated the recovery of the hematopoietic system at day 20 post-irradiation. Sca-1 is not informative as an HSPC marker in Balb/c mice, therefore this was excluded from the analysis of the primitive hematopoietic cells. We identified Lin−c-Kit+CD150+CD48− cells as LT-HSCs, Lin−c-Kit+CD150−CD48− cells as ST-HSCs and Lin−c-Kit+ cells as hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The frequency of LT-HSCs was significantly increased in the central marrow EC treated mice, but not PlGF knockdown EC or central marrow SC treated mice compared to PBS treated controls. Similarly, the frequency of HPCs was significantly increased in the central marrow EC treated mice, but not in PlGF knockdown EC or central marrow SC treated mice (Figure 5A). The frequency of ST-HSCs in the central marrow EC treated mice suggested an increase, but was not significantly different (Figure 5A). To assess the function of the primitive hematopoietic cells, we performed CAFC assays. We found that the frequency of day 14 and day 35 CAFCs from central marrow EC treated mice were significantly higher than that from PlGF knockdown central marrow EC or PBS treated mice (Figure 5B). The frequency of CAFC in central marrow stromal cells demonstrated an increase at day 14, but no difference at day 35 compared with PBS treated mice (Figure 5B). These results demonstrated that, similar to previous reports, the administration of central marrow ECs were able to accelerate the recovery of hematopoiesis, however reduction of PlGF expression in the same cells abrogated this effect. Knockdown of PlGF expression in central marrow ECs inhibits the recovery of BM vasculature in vivo  In the Balb/c mice that were treated with central marrow ECs, PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs, central marrow SCs and PBS following irradiation at 550cGy, we observed a regression of BM sinusoid vessels by H&E and anti-VE-cadherin immunohistochemical staining (Figure 6A). To characterize the degree of regenerating sinusoid vessels, we quantified morphologically normal vessels and pathologic vessels, presenting as dilated or discontinuous vessels based on the VE-Cadherin+ BM ECs (Figure 6B). We observed a predominance of pathologic vessels in PBS, central marrow SC and PlGF knockdown central marrow EC treated mice. However, in central marrow EC treated mice there was significant vascular recovery (Figure 6C). Furthermore, we examined the frequency of ECs in BM, defined as CD31+CD45−Ter119−, and found that the frequency of these cells in the BM of central marrow EC treated mice was significantly higher than the other treated mice (Figure 6D). These results indicated that the administration of central marrow ECs were able to augment the replenishment of BM vasculature. However, reduction of PlGF expression in the same cells disturbed this effect. Transplanted central marrow ECs contributed to the BM vasculature recovery in irradiated mice To determine whether the transplanted central marrow ECs were directly incorporated into the reconstituting vasculature of the BM, central marrow ECs and SCs were labeled with CFDA-SE and injected into the irradiated mice. Our results demonstrate that the central marrow ECs had a greater frequency of homing to BM and spleen compared with central marrow SCs as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 7A). A reduced homing level of PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs in BM, but similar homing level in spleen, was detected compared to the mock transduced central marrow ECs (Figure 7A). With respect to lodgment of the central marrow ECs, histologic assessment of the tibias showed that the 37.5% CFDA-SE+ cells were contiguous with the vascular endothelium (Figure 7B top), while 62.5% CFDA-SE+ cells were within the BM space (Figure 7B bottom). CFDA-SE+ cells were not detected in the BM of the mice treated with PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs or central marrow SCs (data not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the cultured central marrow ECs were capable of homing to BM and lodging in the BM vascular niche, which presumably led to augmented recovery of hematopoiesis and the vasculature in BM of the irradiated mice. While the PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs were able to home to the spleen similar to the controls, they had a specific defect in homing to the vasculature structures of the BM. Therefore, PlGF may play a role in the recovery of hematopoiesis through multiple different mechanisms involving direct effects of the HSPCs, as well as interactions with other BMECs. These studies thus highlight the challenge of separating direct effects of ECs on the primitive hematopoietic cells and on the vasculature, which may in turn affect the HSPCs.

PS1(E280A) partially inhibits γ-secretase-mediated Navβ2 processing. a Western blot analysis of Navβ2 full-length and CTF levels in stable cell lines co-expressing Navβ2 and wild type PS1 (wtPS1) or PS1 containing E280A, M146L, ΔE9 or D333G mutations. Cells were pretreated with DMSO or 500 nM DAPT for 24 hrs. b, c The PS1(E280A) mutation also decreased β2-ICD generation in a cell-free γ-secretase cleavage assay (b) and in membrane extracts from PS1(E280A) cells coexpressing a recombinant myc-β2-CTF (c). PS1(E280A) decreased Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels. a Relative Nav1.1 mRNA levels were measured by real-time RT-PCR in all clones stably expressing Navβ2 and PS1 with or without E280A mutation (*, P<0.05; n=3 for wtPS1 and 4 for PS1(E280A); Student's t-test). b Western blot analyses of Nav1.1 levels in select stable cell lines expressing similar levels of Navβ2 and wtPS1 or PS1(E280A). c Surface levels of sodium channel α-subunits were significantly decreased in PS1(E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 control cells. d Quantitation of c (*, P<0.05; n=3; Student's t-test). Diagram illustrating how the PS1 E280A mutation regulates voltage-gated sodium channel levels.

Results Serial differential ultracentrifugation separates Leishmania spp.-derived extracellular vesicles into three morphologically diverse populations To identify potential new markers for Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes, we adapted the methods used by Kowal et al., 2016, whereby preparations of extracellular vesicles (EV) are fractionated into three distinct groups using serial differential ultracentrifugation at 2,000 x g (2K), 10,000 x g (10K) and 100,000 x g (100K) – corresponding to the relative centrifugal forces required to pellet apoptotic bodies, ectosomes and exosomes, respectively. This approach enabled us to isolate the three major classes of EVs produced by the parasite, facilitating the characterization and differentiation of the exosome-enriched fraction (100K) from the other fractions. To first validate that the fractions corresponded to their respective classes of Leishmania spp.-derived EVs, we performed TEM and NTA to observe distinct morphological characteristics. NTA revealed that the three preparations were composed of EVs with different size distributions, peaks, and curve profiles ( Figure 1 ). The 2K fraction displayed the highest EV diameters, followed by the 10K fraction and the 100K fraction. Furthermore, the 100K fraction contained the highest concentration of vesicles with a diameter from 100-300 nm, indicating an enrichment in small EVs. TEM observations were consistent with the NTA results, revealing that the 2K fraction contained a diverse and heterogenous population of vesicles with large diameters, and that the 10K fraction consisted of intermediate-sized vesicles. The 100K fraction was composed of small EVs, including those with a diameter of 50-150 nm and a cup-shaped double membrane, which are qualities characteristic of exosomes ( Figure 1 ). Together, these data indicate that the 2K, 10K, and 100K extracted fractions are composed of EVs that display characteristic morphological traits of large vesicles (e.g., apoptotic bodies), intermediate-sized vesicles (e.g., ectosomes), and small vesicles (e.g., exosomes), respectively. Fractionated leishmanial extracellular vesicle populations display distinct proteome functionality and expression profiles Following the confirmation of distinct morphological traits of the EVs present in each fraction, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the three fractions using LC-MS/MS and a bioinformatic workflow. When mapped to the L. major database, our analysis identified 610 proteins in the 2K fraction, 754 proteins in the 10K fraction, and 568 proteins in the 100K fraction ( Data Sheet 1 ). Of these, the 100K fraction, which contained the highest proportion of small EVs, displayed the highest relative abundance of canonical exosomal markers ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). To further characterize the proteomic landscape of each fraction, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the proteins identified in each EV subgroup using StringDB. The PPI network for the 2K fraction revealed large clusters associated with ribosomal functions, chaperones, and the nucleotide salvage pathways ( Figure 2A ). The 10K network had significant clustering associated with chaperones, signal transduction, tryparedoxin, glycolysis, ribosomal functions, mitochondrial functions, flagellar functions, oxidative phosphorylation, and translation/tRNA pathways ( Figure 2B ). The PPI network for the 100K fraction displayed clusters associated with glycolysis, ribosomal functions, chaperones, and translation/tRNA pathways, as well as unique clusters related to exocytosis and multivesicular body formation ( Figure 2C ). Overall, these networks revealed common and distinct functionalities between the proteomes of the different fractions, such as the mitochondrial pathways in the 10K fraction and exocytosis/MVB Formation in the 100K fraction. To further establish functional differences between the proteomes of each EV fraction, we analyzed the total detected proteins using the PANTHER database for gene ontology – a bioinformatic analysis workflow which classifies and identifies gene products’ functions based on their family and subfamily, molecular function, biological processes, and cellular components. Of note, no significant differences in the percentages of total classified proteins for each subcategory were apparent between the fractions when classified according to biological process and molecular function, despite the total number of identified proteins varying between the samples ( Supplementary Tables 1, 2 ) ( Figures 3A, C ). However, when classified according to cellular components, notable differences between the fractions were observed, suggesting differences in cellular origin between the EV populations (Level 3 - Membrane-bound organelle) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) ( Figure 3B ). The percentage of total protein composition attributed to a mitochondrial origin showed an evident decreasing pattern in the 2K, 10K, and 100K fractions, which were 29.60%, 15.60%, and 7%, respectively, while proteins of vacuolar origin increased from 29.60% to 30.20% and 40.40%, respectively ( Supplementary Table 3 ). We then delved deeper into the proteins of vacuolar origin in each fraction, which are involved in EV biogenesis, and identified several proteins related to the ESCRT pathway in the 100K fraction, notably CHMP2A, CHMP2B, SNF-7, and VTA1. Analysis of the proteomic landscapes of each EV fraction using the PANTHER database revealed their differential cellular origins and underscored a remarkable enrichment of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, vacuolar sorting and the ESCRT pathway in the 100K fractionated EV population. Overall, this analysis indicated that the three fractions comprised different functional elements of varying cellular origins. To further investigate the differences between the proteomes of each EV fraction, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the detected proteins to determine their expression levels and enrichment in EV subpopulations. Our analysis revealed that there were 131 proteins significantly enriched in the 2K fraction, 11 in the 10K fraction, and 57 in the 100K fraction, and that these enriched protein sets shared no overlap between fractions ( Figures 4A, B ;  Table 1 ) ( Data Sheet 2 ). These data further corroborated that these fractions are composed of different EV populations and confirmed the presence of enriched protein sets within each class of Leishmania spp.-derived EVs. To further characterize the functionality of such enriched proteins, we used StringDB PPI analysis on the enriched protein sets to generate networks of functional and physical interaction clusters. The network of proteins enriched in the 2K fraction displayed four distinct clusters related to histone complexes, signal transduction, transcription/ribosomal pathways, and cellular respiration. In contrast, no significant interaction networks could be identified for the 10K fraction, likely due to few enriched proteins identified within the fraction ( Figure 4D ). Enriched proteins in the 100K fraction formed three main clusters: endoplasmic glycosylation, cysteine pathway, and vacuolar sorting/ESCRT pathway ( Figures 4C, E ). These data highlight that the proteins enriched in each EV fraction have distinct functional and biological roles, confirming the distinction between the fractionated populations. We then compared the quantitative protein expression profiles between the three distinct fractions by generating volcano plots (2K vs. 100K, 2K vs. 10K, and 10K vs. 100K), plotting the fold change of protein expression against the significance of enrichment. Each plot showed a distinct protein expression spread, identifying proteins significantly enriched in each EV fraction. For example, when comparing the 2K and 100K fractions, proteins related to aerobic metabolism, notably citrate synthase and ATP synthase, were significantly enriched within the 2K fraction, whereas important parasitic virulence factors, like EF-1, GP63, and superoxide dismutase, were enriched within the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Furthermore, this same enrichment of parasitic virulence factors in the 100K fraction was observed in comparison to the 10K fraction, with additional enrichment of VPS4, an important component of the ESCRT complex. Additionally, this analysis identified cellular metabolic pathway-related proteins enriched within the 10K fraction as compared to the 100K fraction, particularly enzymes related to glycolysis and the citrate cycle, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and citrate synthase ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Finally, when comparing the 2K and 10K fraction proteomes, enrichment of citrate cycle proteins, such as citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, was observed in the 2K fraction, while the 10K fraction displayed enrichment of glycolysis-related proteins like enolase and pyruvate kinase ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). In summary, this analysis confirmed our previous observations that each EV fraction has distinct characteristics of protein enrichment and functionality, particularly in cellular aerobic metabolism in both the 2K and 10K fractions and virulence factors and ESCRT pathway proteins in the 100K fraction. Classical biomarkers for leishmanial exosome validation are non-specific to small extracellular vesicles To gain further insight into the characteristics of the Leishmania spp.-derived exoproteome, we conducted a detailed analysis of the key proteins identified, comparing them with established predictive markers such as HSP70, HSP83, GP63, Tryparedoxin peroxidase, Enolase, EF-1, and Surface Antigen Protein, among others. Both HSP83 and HSP70 were identified in all three EV fractions, with similar expression levels. In fact, while HSP70 was slightly upregulated in the 10K fraction, this was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no significant variation in the expression levels of EF-1, Tryparedoxin peroxidase, Calpain-like cysteine peptidase, and 14-3-3 protein between the fractions. GP63, Enolase, and Surface Antigen Protein did, however, show an increasing trend in expression from the 2K to the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Together, these findings suggest that common predictive markers for Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes are non-specific, though key virulence factors such as GP63 are significantly enriched in populations of smaller leishmanial EVs. Proteins involved in the leishmanial ESCRT pathway and the phosphatase system are specific to Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes Finally, an in-depth investigation was conducted to identify potential novel markers of Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes. The study focused on the 70, 36, and 32 proteins that were uniquely identified in the 2K, 10K, and 100K EV fractions, respectively ( Figure 5A ;  Supplementary Tables 5–7 ). Notably, the 100K fraction exhibited the presence of SNF-7 and Qc-SNARE proteins, which are both involved in the ESCRT pathway, suggesting their potential as identifying markers. Additionally, 14 proteins were identified in the 100K fraction that were uncharacterized in the UNIPROT database, necessitating further examination. Homology searches conducted on closely related species in UNIPROT allowed for the identification of six homologous proteins involved in the ESCRT pathway: IST1, SNF-7 superfamily, VTA1, CHMP2B, ALIX, and VPS37 ( Supplementary Table 7 ). To further characterize the 32 proteins that were uniquely expressed in the 100K fraction, StringDB analysis was conducted, revealing four protein-protein interaction clusters which could be classified as ESCRT pathway-related (SNF-7 and Qc-SNARE), tRNA-associated, Glucose Transporters, and Parasite Phosphatases (PP5 and PRL-1) ( Figure 5B ).

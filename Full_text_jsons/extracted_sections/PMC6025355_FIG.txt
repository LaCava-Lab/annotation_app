Schematic representation of the LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 reporter. The intact DEVD linker between LSS-mOrange and mKate2 causes the two fluorescent proteins to be spatially close and experience increased FRET. This increase in FRET causes a decrease in the donor (LSS-mOrange) lifetime. Once the DEVD linker is enzymatically cleaved by active caspase-3, LSS-mOrange and mKate2 can spatially separate. This causes FRET to decrease and the donor (LSS-mOrange) lifetime to increase. MDA-MB-231 cells show increased apoptosis with nutrient starvation. Left. MDA-MB-231 cells that have been starved of both glutamine and glucose (bottom) show a higher proportion of red pixels (indicating apoptosis) than the control, nutrient-rich condition (top). Right. The phasor plot indicates the ROIs that were selected. The numbers below the phasor plot indicate ROI spatial information. Points nearest the origin on the x-axis have a longer lifetime. The orange ROI indicates pixels with a shorter lifetime (no caspase-3 activity, FRET is occurring) and the red ROI indicates pixels with a longer lifetime (caspase-3 activity and apoptosis, no FRET).

Results   Table 1  summarizes the demographic features and hematological/biochemical parameters among the COVID-19 patients enrolled in this study. Of the 109 patients studied, 23 were viral RNA positive asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 index cases while 63 patients were symptomatic with mild (n=32) or severe (n=31) disease. Among 31 patients suffering from severe disease, 19 (61.3%) required mechanical ventilation for oxygen support and 11 (35.5%) succumbed to the infection. Expression Levels of Alpha-Defensins (DEFA1), S100A8/A9 and MPO Proteins in COVID-19 Patients   Figure 1  depicts circulatory levels of (A) DEFA1, (B) S100A8/A9 and (C) MPO in serum/plasma samples of COVID-19 patients. As compared to the healthy subjects (mean 113±11), a significant increase in alpha-defensins (DEFA1) was recorded in the patients with mild (mean 230±17, p<0.0001) or severe disease (mean 452±46, p<0.0001,  Figure 1A ). Importantly, the rise was more pronounced in the patients with severe disease than those with mild infection (p=0.0001). Asymptomatic individuals were comparable to healthy controls (p=0.53). During convalescence, a significant drop was evident in DEFA1 levels from the patients with mild (p=0.004) and severe (p<0.0001) infections. At this time, alpha-defensins levels returned to normal levels comparable with the healthy controls (p=0.49). Irrespective of disease severity, the levels of S100A8/A9 were elevated in all the individuals with asymptomatic (p<0.0001) and symptomatic (p<0.0001) infections, when compared to the healthy controls ( Figure 1B ). However, the rise was not significantly different among symptomatic infections with mild or severe disease (p=0.48). During convalescence, the levels of S100A8/A9 were comparable to healthy controls (p=0.11). In a subset of samples, MPO levels were determined ( Figure 1C ). Similar to DEFA1, MPO levels were unaltered during subclinical infection (p=0.85) while a significant increase was observed in the patients with mild (p=0.01) and severe (p=0.02) disease. However, the difference with respect to disease severity was not significant (p=0.29). During convalescence, MPO levels were comparable to healthy controls (p=0.42). To understand the dynamics of neutrophil secretory proteins in COVID-19 patients, expression levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO proteins were compared at different time points post onset of disease (POD) ( Figures 1D–F ). During the first week of the disease, levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO proteins were elevated that remained higher during the second week. Subsequently, significant decline was seen in all the three proteins. This suggests that neutrophil remained activated till 14 days post infection and returned back to resting state by 15-30 days post infection. Expression Levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO Proteins in Relation to Disease Severity in COVID-19 Patients Next, the levels of neutrophil secretory proteins with respect to disease severity and PODs were compared ( Figures 2A–C ). Interestingly, DEFA1 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with severe disease during the first week itself (p=0.004). No significant difference was observed during the second (p=0.052) and the third (p=0.97) weeks post onset of disease. S100A8/A9 and MPO levels did not differ among mild and severe disease patients at different time points post onset of disease. To understand whether the increased expression of neutrophil secretory proteins is associated with the onset of severity, the levels of these proteins were compared with respect to the day on which severity was first identified. Of the 31 severe disease patients, 16 (52%), 9 (29%) and 6 (19%) were respectively collected within 0-3, 4-7 and 8-23 days of the identification of severity. Expression levels of all the three proteins were elevated within 7 days post identification of severe disease ( Figure 2D ) suggesting that higher levels of neutrophil secretory proteins are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Next, DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 levels were determined in patients with mild (n=9) and severe disease (n=7) at two time points. For patients with mild disease, first sampling was done at the time of admission (POD 2-14) and second sampling was done at 6-12 days later (POD 8-21). An increase in DEFA1 levels was evident in the mild disease (p=0.004,  Figure 2E ). On contrary, levels of S100A8/A9 decreased in 7 out of 9 mild patients (p=0.004,  Figure 2E ). For patients with severe disease, the duration between first (POD 5-14) and second (POD 7-19) sampling was 2-5 days. During the follow up, DEFA1 levels increased in 5/7 patients (p=0.02,  Figure 2F ) while a decrease in S100A8/A9 levels was recorded in 4/7 patients (p=0.02,  Figure 2F ). Expression Levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO Proteins in Relation to Disease Severity and Mechanical Ventilation/Secondary Infection In view of the fact that a large proportion of severe disease patients require mechanical ventilation and develop secondary infections, further analyses were undertaken to assess the contribution of these confounding factors in the observed rise of neutrophil secretory proteins. In our series, ~95% of the severe patients undergoing intubation developed secondary infection. As evident from  Figure 3 , the expression levels of all the three proteins were similar in both the groups ( Figure 3A ). We further compared the expression of all the three proteins in relation to the duration between the day of secondary diagnosis and sampling ( Figures 3B–D ). Clearly, high expression of these proteins was not related to secondary bacterial infection but the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Next, we compared the expression levels of neutrophil secretory proteins in the patients with severe disease in relation to the disease outcome ( Figure 3E ). DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 expression levels were significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (p=0.004; p=0.03 respectively) suggesting that neutrophil activation is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. No difference in the levels of MPO protein was observed (p=0.56). Comparison of these proteins in severe patients requiring mechanical ventilation revealed that the rise was independent of the use of mechanical ventilator for oxygen support ( Figure 3F ). Furthermore, odds-ratio analysis revealed that poor outcome of the disease was strongly associated with the requirement of mechanical ventilation by the patients suffering from severe illness (OR = 12). To examine the possible contribution of mechanical ventilation or secondary infection in raising the DEFA1 levels in severe patients, a separate analysis was undertaken. DEFA1 levels were significantly higher when patients with severe disease without these confounding factors (n=11; 385±65 ng/mL) were compared patients with mild disease (n=32; 230±17 ng/mL, p=0.02). Thus, higher expression of DEFA1 during severe COVID-19 infection was independent of mechanical ventilation or secondary infection. DEFA1 as Potential Biomarker for Severity To explore, if DEFA1 levels can be used to differentiate between mild and severe disease presentations, three different concentrations of DEFA1 were evaluated (250, 300 and 350 ng/mL). At 250ng/mL, DEFA1 could differentiate between mild and severe disease presentations (OR = 3.68). At 300 ng/mL DEFA1 concentration, odds-ratio increased to 11.34 and at 350ng/mL DEFA1 concentration, odds ratio further increased to 13.38. ROC curve analysis revealed that at 314 ng/mL, the estimated sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 91% respectively ( Figure 3G ). The AUC value for alpha-defensin was 0.78 ± 0.06 (95% CI = 0.66 to 0.89, p<0.0002), suggesting that DEFA1 levels could act as a potential biomarker in predicting disease severity in COVID-19. Correlation Analysis Among Different Parameters Certain clinical parameters such as Neutrophils to Lymphocytes ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer have been associated with severity of COVID-19. We attempted to correlate these parameters with known significance with the proteins evaluated in this study ( Figure 4 ). DEFA1 levels were found to be positively correlated with NLR (r=0.42, p=0.02). S100A8/A9 expression levels were found to be positively correlated with CRP (r=0.36, p=0.05).

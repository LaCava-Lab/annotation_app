2. Results and Discussion The phytochemical study of M. tamnifolia led to the isolation and identification of nine compounds, whose structures are shown in Figure 1. The spectral properties of these known compounds, including 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data, were identical to those previously described in the literature. Among the species of this genus, (+)-catechin (7) and quercitrin (9) have been reported only in M. platyclada. Lupeol acetate (1), cis-p-coumaric acid (2), lupeol (3), β-sitosterol (4), trans-p-coumaric acid (5), linoleic acid (6) and afzelin (8) are reported here for the first time in this genus. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 1 shows the presence of an acetyl group as a singlet at 2.05 ppm, typical of the methyl bonded to a carboxyl group. The 13C-NMR shows a signal at 173.8 ppm, consistent with the carbon atom of an ester group, and a signal at 21.4 ppm corresponding to the methyl group of an acetyl derivative. The remaining 1H- and 13C-NMR signals are similar to those obtained for compound 3. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 2 (Figure 1) displayed two doublets, one at 7.63 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz) and 6.79 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz) ppm, typical of a 1,4-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets at 6.83 (1H, J = 12.5 Hz) and 5.82 (1H, J = 12.5 Hz) ppm revealed the presence of a cis olefin coupling, corresponding to H-7 and H-8 in the proposed structure. The above spectral features are in close agreement to those observed for cis-p-coumaric acid. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 shows six singlets, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups, between 0.75 and 1.02 ppm and a singlet at 1.25 ppm, typical of a methyl group in an isopropenyl system. Two olefinic protons at 4.68 and 4.56 ppm are consistent with the methylene group of the same propylenic system. The 13C-NMR data shows the characteristic signals of C-3 at 79.2 ppm, C-20 at 151.1 ppm and C-29 at 109.5 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 4 shows two signals, two methine groups at 3.51 and another at 5.35 ppm, consistent with H-3 and H-6 of a steroid nucleus. The 13C-NMR spectrum showed 29 carbon atoms including an oxymethine carbon signal at 72.0 ppm, two olefinic carbons at 140.9 and 121.9 ppm and two methylene carbon signals at 34.1 and 26.2 ppm, corresponding to C-23 and C-22. The 1H-NMR spectrum acquired for compound 5 (Figure 1) was almost identical to that of cis-p-coumaric acid (2), suggesting a close structural similarity between these two compounds. The difference is found in two doublets (J = 16.0 Hz) centered at 7.64 and 6.29 ppm which suggest the trans-derivative of compound 2. Compound 6 was characterized using GC-MS. Peak identification was carried out by comparing the recorded mass spectra with those present in the instrument library (WILEY 7n.l). The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 7 shows three signals corresponding to aromatic protons at 6.72, 6.76 and 6.83, corresponding to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted ring. The spectrum also shows the signals of two aromatic proton signals at 5.85 and 5.93 ppm, typical of a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted ring. Two oxygenated methine protons signals are located at 3.97 and 4.56 ppm, consistent with H-3 and H-2 in the structure of catechin, respectively. Moreover, two methylenic diastereotopic proton signals can be observed at 2.55 and 2.87 ppm, which is consistent with position 4 of catechin. The 13C-NMR spectrum and DEPT experiment show five oxygenated quaternary aromatic signals at 157.8, 157.6, 156.9, 146.2 and 146.2 ppm, two non-oxygenated quaternary aromatic signals at 132.2 and 100.8 ppm, and five CH aromatic signals at 120.0, 116.1, 115.2, 96.3 and 95.5 ppm. Two oxygenated methine carbons signals at 82.8 and 68.8 ppm and one methylene carbon signal at 28.5 ppm are also present. The metabolite has been identified as the dextrorotatory enantiomer by polarimetry. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 8 shows the proton signals of a para-disubstituted benzene ring at 7.77 and 6.93 ppm, those of a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted benzene ring at 6.38 and 6.20 ppm, that of a typical anomeric proton doublet at 5.38 ppm and the signals of a sugar moiety between 4.20 and 2.00 ppm. Furthermore, the characteristic doublet of the rhamnose methyl group is present at 0.92 ppm. The 13C-NMR spectrum showed 21 signals, including the one of an α,β-unsaturated ketone at 179.6 ppm. Six signals of quaternary aromatic and olefinic oxygenated carbon atoms are present at 165.9, 163.2, 161.6, 159.3, 158.6 and 136.1 ppm, while two quaternary aromatic non-oxygenated atoms correspond to signals at 122.6 and 105.73 ppm. Other CH aromatic carbon atoms are represented by signals at 131.9 (positions 2′ and 6′), 116.5 (positions 3′ and 5′), 100.1 and 94.9 ppm. The rhamnose moiety anomeric carbon atom corresponds to the signal at 103.5 ppm. The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 9 shows the proton signals of a 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring at 7.33, 7.31 and 6.91 ppm, and the remaining signals are in complete agreement with those previously reported for compound 8. α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibition Activity In the α-amylase assay only the hexanic extract was active at the maximum dose tested (625 μg/mL with a sample solution of 10 mg/mL). The other extracts and compounds exhibited inhibition percentages less than 35% at the tested conditions and were not included in this report. For the α-glucosidase assay, both hexanic and methanolic extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity and only four compounds were active. Three of them belonging to the flavonoid family and one belonging to the essential fatty acids group exhibited strong inhibitory activity, with IC50 values below than 8 μM (Table 1). Their inhibitory activities were even 48.5- to 754-fold higher than the commercial drug Acarbose (IC50 = 377 μM). The remaining five compounds exhibited no inhibitory activity over α-glucosidase at the maximum dose tested (less than 1% of enzyme inhibition) and only trans-p-coumaric acid exhibited 27% of enzyme inhibition. The activity of Afzelin (Kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside) was 20-fold higher compared to the activity reported by Ajish et al., who obtained an IC50 value of 81.16 μM. The method described previously in the methodology measures the pNP released during 60 min which allows us to obtain more reliable data by measuring enzymatic catalysis for a long period of time instead of short periods or even end point measurements. Additionally, using a high amount of enzyme can greatly affect the IC50 value obtained. Moreover, the flavonoids have demonstrated to be moderate to strong inhibitors of α-glucosidase, with IC50 values below 100 μM. Linoleic acid was demonstrated to be the most potent compound, followed by afzelin, (+)-catechin and quercitrin. PUFA (polyunsatured fatty acids) have been demonstrated to be good inhibitors of glucosidase, exhibiting different types of inhibition and potency, as demonstrated by Liu et al., where C18 unsaturated fatty acids where more active versus longer fatty acid chains with more double bonds (or even no double bonds). The α-glucosidase inhibitors acting toward enzymes in the intestine have been shown to effectively delay the blood glucose level, lowering glucose absorption.

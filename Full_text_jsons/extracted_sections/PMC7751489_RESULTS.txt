Results CBX2 is overexpressed in GC cell lines By searching the CCLE, the results demonstrated that CBX2 expression was increased in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric cells (Fig. 1A). To confirm whether CBX2 expression was increased in GC cell lines, RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed. In the present study, normal gastric GES-1 cells and GC cell lines, including MFC, HGC-27, AGS and MKN-45, were selected to investigate the role of CBX2 in GC. The results demonstrated that CBX2 expression was significantly elevated in GC cells compared with GES-1 cells (Fig. 1B and C). As the highest level of CBX2 was observed in MFC cells, this cell line was selected for further experimentation. The results indicated that upregulated CBX2 expression may be involved in GC pathogenesis. CBX2 knockdown inhibits the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway To investigate the role of CBX2 and its underlying mechanism in GC pathogenesis, the effect of CBX2 on the β-catenin signaling pathway was analyzed. shRNA-CBX2 was constructed to downregulate CBX2 expression. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the knockdown effect of shRNA-CBX2-1 was greater than that of shRNA-CBX2-2. Therefore, shRNA-CBX2-1 was used for further experimentation (Fig. 1D). Western blotting was subsequently performed to detect the expression of β-catenin and its various downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1. The results demonstrated that the expression of c-myc, cyclin D1 and nuclear β-catenin in the shRNA-CBX2-1 group were significantly decreased compared with the control, while total β-catenin expression showed no significant difference (Fig. 1E and F). The results revealed that CBX2 knockdown inhibited the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. CBX2 knockdown inhibits GC cell proliferation by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway To confirm whether the β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the role of CBX2 in GC, shRNA-DKK1 was synthesized. As DKK1 is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, DKK1 was silenced to activate β-catenin signaling. Due to its higher transfection efficiency, shRNA-DKK1-1 was selected for further use, as determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2A). A CCK-8 assay was carried out to evaluate the viability of MFC cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 or shRNA-DKK1-1 at the indicated time points (0, 24, 48 and 72 h). As presented in Fig. 2B, cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 demonstrated a lower viability compared with the control, whereas cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 and shRNA-DKK1-1 demonstrated increased viability compared with shRNA-CBX2-1 transfected cells. A colony formation assay was subsequently performed to determine MFC cell proliferation. As presented in Fig. 2C, MFC cell proliferation was suppressed by shRNA-CBX2-1 transfection, which was subsequently abolished by shRNA-DKK1-1 transfection. These data suggested that CBX2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway. CBX2 knockdown inhibits the migration and invasion of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway To further confirm the role of CBX2 in GC, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to assess migration and invasion, respectively. As presented in Fig. 3A-D, the migration and invasion of MFC cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 was significantly inhibited compared with the control, whereas shRNA-CBX2-1 + shRNA-DKK1-1 co-transfection reversed this effect. It has been demonstrated that MMP7 and MMP13 are significantly upregulated in malignant tumors, and are associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. As presented in Fig. 3E, the expression of MMP7 and MMP13 were significantly downregulated in MFC cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 compared with controls. Furthermore, transfection with shRNA-DKK1-1 inhibited the CBX2 knockdown-induced suppression of MMP7 and MMP13 expression. The results indicated that CBX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway. CBX2 knockdown promotes YAP phosphorylation and its nuclear cytoplasm translocation The present study determined that CBX2 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin pathway. However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. To determine the underlying mechanism associated with the effect of CBX2 in GC, the expression of P-YAP, cytoplasmic YAP and nuclear YAP were detected via western blotting. The results demonstrated that the phosphorylation of YAP in the shRNA-CBX2-1 group was significantly upregulated compared with the control, whereas the expression levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP were downregulated (Fig. 4). The results revealed that CBX2 exerted a regulatory effect on YAP expression. YAP overexpression reverses the inhibitory effect of CBX2 knockdown on the β-catenin signaling pathway To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of CBX2 and GC, a YAP overexpression plasmid was constructed. The expression of YAP was analyzed via RT-qPCR and western blotting. As presented in Fig. 5A, YAP expression was increased in MFC cells transfected with overexpression-YAP plasmids compared with control cells. Additionally, western blotting was performed to evaluate the expression of β-catenin and its downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1, after transfection with or without shRNA-CBX2-1 and overexpression-YAP plasmids. The results demonstrated that shRNA-CBX2-1 transfection led to a significant reduction in the expression of the aforementioned proteins, which was consistent with Fig. 1D. As predicted, YAP overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of CBX2 knockdown on protein expression (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these data indicated that CBX2 promoted GC pathogenesis by activating the YAP/β-catenin pathway.

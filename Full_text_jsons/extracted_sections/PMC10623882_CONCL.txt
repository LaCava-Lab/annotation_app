Conclusion Our findings established a strong connection between BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 and CSC stemness in BC. By providing unidentified evidence that nuclear PD-L1 and RelB promote IL-6 production, the BRD4 inhibitor repressed breast CSC formation, suppressed immune evasion in immunogenic tumors, and increased CD8 + T-cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 10).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation and analytical characterization of oleacein mimetics CHEMBL2143987 (N-(2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)acetamide) A mixture of 4-nitrophenylacetic acid (100 mg, 0.552 mmol) and CDI (94mg, 0.58 mmol) in DMF (1.4 mL) was stirred at 50° C for 10 min. The solution was cooled to 20° C, N,N-dimethylaminoethylamine (63.6 μL, 0.58 mmol) was added dropwise and the solution stirred for 2 h. The solution was poured into water and extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic extracts were washed with water, brine, dried, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed, eluting with a DCM/MeOH (1%NH3) yielding N-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-2-4-nitrophenylacetamide (27 mg, 19.5%). CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-Allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide) 5-Nitrofuran-2-carbaldehyde (100 mg, 0.709 mmol), N-allylhydrazinecarbothioamide (93 mg, 0.709 mmol), p-TSA (6.74 mg, 0.035 mmol) and toluene (7.0 mL) were stirred at room temperature until the aldehyde was not present (1.5h). The solid formed (136 mg, 75%) was collected by filtration. CHEMBL126593 (N-(4-Nitrobenzyl)ethenesulfonamide) 4-Nitrophenyl)methanamine (100 mg, 0.657 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (620 μL, dry) at 0° C with stirring under N2 to which a 4-methylmorpholine (145 μl, 1.314 mmol) was added with stirring. A solution of y 2-chloroethanesulfonyl chloride (68.7 μl, 0.657 mmol) dissolved in DCM (620 μL, dry) was added at 0° C with stirring 10 min under N2, after which time the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid and the organic layers were collected, dried (MgSO4), filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc/n-hexane 1/2). The product was obtained as a white solid (11 mg, 7%). CHEMBL1950046 (3,4-Dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate) Lipase P (25 mg) and vinyl butyrate (412 μl, 3.24 mmol) were added to a solution of 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzene-1,2-diol (25 mg, 0.162 mmol) in tBuOMe (Volume: 5792 μl) and the mixture was shaken at 40° C for 60 min. The reaction was quenched by filtering off enzyme and the filtrate was evaporated in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed with sat. NaHCO3 and brine then dried (MgSO4) followed by filtration and evaporation to dryness. 32 mg (89%) of compound identified as the title compound were obtained. CHEMBL1890048 (2-Methoxy-N-(2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl)acetamide) To a solution of 2-methyl-5-nitroaniline (100 mg, 0.657 mmol) in DCM (0.04 M), TEA (0.137 ml, 0.986 mmol) and2-methoxyacetyl chloride (0.066 μl, 0.723 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h. 103 mg (70%) of compound identified as the title compound were obtained. CHEMBL1085246 (N-(4-Chloro-5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)hexanamide) Hexanoyl chloride (38.2 μl, 0.278 mmol) was dissolved in THF (0.1 M) and cooled to -78° C then 4-chloro-5-nitrothiazol-2-amine (50 mg, 0.278 mmol) was added in one portion. DIPEA (1.1 eq) was added to the resulting slurry at -78° C and the solution was held at this temperature for 10 min then allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. The solution was diluted with EtOAc and washed with sat. NaHCO3, 1M HCl and brine then dried (MgSO4) followed by filtration and evaporation to dryness. The resulting residue was purified by gradient flash column chromatography (10-60% EtOAc/hexanes or 1-2% MeOH/CH2Cl2) to obtain 22 mg (28.5%) of compound identified as the title compound. CHEMBL45196 (4-((5-Chloro-2-nitrophenyl)amino)-4-oxo-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido)butanoic acid) A mixture of 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline (50 mg, 0.290 mmol) and (S)-N-(2,5-dioxotetrahydrofuran-3-yl)-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamide (61.2 mg, 0.290 mmol) was irradiated for 60 minutes in a microwave (130° C, 200 psi, 200W). The residue was purified by reversed-phase flash chromatography, yielding 14 mg (12%) of compound identified as the title compound. CHEMBL357073 (6-[(4-nitrophenyl)formamido]hexanoic acid), CHEMBL1545778 ([2-(methylcarbamoylamino)-2-oxo-ethyl] (E)-3-(3-bromophenyl)prop-2-enoate), CHEMBL1366164 (ethyl 2-[(2-methyl-5-nitro-phenyl)amino]-2-oxoacetate), and CHEMBL1642794 ([2-(tert-butylamino)-2-oxo-ethyl] 4-nitrobenzoate) were purchased from Enamine (EN300-302808, Z18646098, EN300-236023, and Z19756482, respectively; Kiev, Ukraine). CHEMBL1440472 (2- [(6- chloro- 3- nitro- 2-pyridinyl)amino]-3-methylbutanoic acid) was purchased from Key Organics (MS-1625; Bedford, MA). CHEMBL1621113 (N-[4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane-1,3-diamine) and CHEMBL1079062 ((Z)-4-[(4-nitrophenyl)amino]-4-oxobut-2-enoic acid) were purchased from ABCR GmbH (AB141160 and AB414326, respectively; Karlsruhe, Germany). Analytical and spectroscopic characterization of oleacein mimetics NMR NMR spectra were recorded on an Agilent VNMRS-400 (1H at 400.10 MHz). HPLC-MS. HPLC-MS were performed with a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Thermo Ultimate 3000SD (Thermo Scientific Dionex) coupled to a photodiode array detector and a mass spectrometer LTQ XL ESI-ion trap (Thermo Scientific); 5μl of sample MeOH were injected (c=0.5mg/mL). Data from mass spectra were analyzed by electrospray ionization in positive and negative mode and peaks are given m/z (% of basis peak). The mobile phase used was a mixture of A = water + 0.05 formic acid and B = Acetonitrile + 0.05 formic acid with method described as follows: flow 0.5 mL/min; 5% B for 0.5 min; 5%-100% B in 5 min, 100% B for 2min. Virtual screening Virtual profiling was performed with ligand- and structure-based software tools, using the chemical structure of oleacein as a seed, as described. Briefly, the 3D virtual profiling tool compares a query molecule (i.e., oleacein) with the structures present in the Chembl(v19) reference database using Comparative Molecular Similarity Indices Analysis (CoMSIA) fields on a 3D grid. Molecules were compared according to their relationship with their environment using the 3D descriptors topologic surface area, lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors count, and Van der Waals radii, among others, thereby obtaining biomimetic compounds with different structures. Docking and molecular dynamics calculations All docking, MD calculations and MM/GBSA rescoring were carried out as described. Cell viability Cell viability was determined using a standard colorimetric MTT-based reduction assay 72 h after exposure to graded concentrations of oleacein mimetics. Mammosphere formation Mammosphere formation was monitored using Cell2Sphere™ assays (StemTek Therapeutics, Bilbao, Spain). Graded concentrations of oleacein mimetics were added to triplicate sets of wells on day 1 and the number of 6-day-old mammospheres was recorded as a measurement of CSC content. Images were recorded using a BioTek Cytation 5 image cytometer at 2.5× magnification. Prior to image acquisition, spheroid cultures were stained with a fluorescent vital dye to increase the accuracy of spheroid detection and analysis. The system was then set to count number, size, and aspect ratio of the objects. Thresholds were set to >100 μm in size and 0.4 as aspect ratio (with 1 being the aspect ratio of a perfect circle). Aldefluor activity assay The ALDEFLUOR® assay (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) was performed with or without the addition of hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide for 48 h. mTOR and DNMT activity/inhibition assays IC50 determinations for FRAP1 (mTOR) of oleacein mimetics were outsourced to Invitrogen (Life Technologies) using the FRET-based Z-LYTE™ SelectScreen Kinase Profiling Service. The effect of oleacein mimetics on the enzymatic activities of the recombinant human DNMT3A was outsourced to Reaction Biology Corp. (Malvern, PA) using HotSpotSM, a nanoliter-scale radioisotope filter binding platform. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA). Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Comparisons of means of ≥ 3 groups were performed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the existence of individual differences, in case of significant F values at ANOVA, were assessed by multiple contrasts. P values < 0.05 and <0.005 were considered to be statistically significant (denoted as * and **, respectively). All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results and Discussion To study the effects of PS1 mutations on Nav1 channels, we stably cotransfected B104 rat neuroblastoma cells with Navβ2 and wtPS1 or PS1(E280A or M146L), both FAD mutations associated with clinical seizures or PS1(ΔE9), a FAD mutation with no reported seizures, or PS2(D333G), a non FAD-linked mutation. B104 cells express endogenous Nav1 channel components and have previously been used for studying Nav1.1 channel regulation by BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase. In these cells, we first analyzed levels of β2-CTF, a direct substrate for PS/γ-secretase (supplemental Fig. 1a). Interestingly, we found that a seizure-related FAD-linked PS1 mutation, E280A increased β2-CTF levels by 3.7 fold as compared to the control cells (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 1b). We also observed a moderate increase of β2-CTF levels (1.9 fold) in PS1(M146L) cells but this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 1b). Ectodomain shedding by ADAM10 or BACE1 was not increased, since we were unable to detect elevated β2-CTF levels in the same cells pretreated with the PS/γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Fig. 1a). This indicates that the E280A mutation prevents PS/γ-secretase cleavage of Navβ2. To confirm this, we quantitated levels of the PS/γ-secretase cleavage product β2-ICD (Fig. 1b and c). Since β2-ICDs are quickly degraded within the cytoplasm, a cell-free γ-secretase cleavage assay system (Fig. 1b) or overexpression of recombinant myc-tagged β2-CTF substrate (Fig. 1c) are required to detect β2-ICDs. Both assays showed a dramatic decrease in β2-ICDs with PS1(E280A) expression (Fig. 1b, c). Steady state levels of myc-β2-CTF were largely elevated in PS1 (E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 controls (supplemental Fig. 2b and c). Together, these data demonstrate that the PS1 E280A mutation decreases PS/γ-secretase–mediated Navβ2 cleavages in neuronal cells. Next, we tested whether the PS1 E280A mutation reduces Nav1.1 levels by decreasing β2-ICD levels. By using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we analyzed Nav1.1 mRNA levels of PS1(E280A) and wtPS1 cell clones ((n= 4 for PS1(E280A) and 3 for wtPS1)). We found that Nav1.1 mRNA levels are dramatically decreased in PS1(E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 cells, which is consistent with decreased β2-ICD levels in these cells (Fig. 2a). As expected, we also found that Nav1.1 protein levels were significantly decreased in PS1(E280A) cells (Fig. 2b). These data strongly indicate that the PS1 E280A mutation decreased Nav1.1 levels by reducing β2-ICD generation in these cells. To test whether the decrease in Nav1.1 levels led to a reduction in functional Nav1 channels, we analyzed cell surface levels of Nav1 α-subunits (Fig. 2c and d). We have previously shown that decreases in surface Nav1 α-subunit levels were directly responsible for decreased sodium currents in the same cells. By using a cell surface biotinylation assay, we found that surface Nav1 α-subunit levels were dramatically decreased in PS1(E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 controls (Fig. 2c and d). Pharmacological inhibition of PS/γ-secretase activity confirmed our data with PS1(E280A) overexpression, as DAPT robustly reduced surface Nav1 α-subunit levels in B104 cells expressing Navβ2 without PS1(E280A) expression (Supplemental Fig. 3). Together, our results indicate that PS1 E280A mutation decreased PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Navβ2, β2-ICD generation, Nav1.1 α-subunit precursor levels, and therefore reduced the surface Nav1 channels and possibly sodium currents and membrane excitability (Fig. 3). Recently, we reported that BACE1 ablation decreased Nav1.1 mRNA and proteins levels in mouse brains due to reduced endogenous β2-ICD levels. Consistent with our findings, Hu et al. also showed that Nav1.1 and Nav1.2/6 levels were significantly decreased in BACE1-null mice, although the changes in Nav1.2/6 were not observed in other reports. A recent study in the PS/APP AD mouse model also showed that the elevated BACE1 levels in these mice led to the accumulation of endogenous β2-ICD in nuclei of cortical neurons, increased, Nav1.1 levels, and possibly contributed to aberrant neuronal activity and cognitive deficits. Together, these data strongly support a physiological role of β2-ICD in regulating Nav1.1 levels in brains. AD patients with PS1 E280A mutation display frequent epileptic seizures at the early ages and a study showed that the early onset seizures in PS1 E280A patients strongly associated with CA1 hippocampal neuronal loss. Recent studies in AD mouse models also provide strong evidence that altered Nav1.1 channel levels are responsible for seizures, abnormal neural activities and even a cognitive decline in these mice. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel molecular pathway that can contribute to AD pathology in patients with PS1 E280A mutation. Further studies will be required to fully elucidate whether PS1(E280A) and possibly other epilepsy-associated PS FAD mutations contribute to AD pathology by modulating Nav1.1 channels in vivo.

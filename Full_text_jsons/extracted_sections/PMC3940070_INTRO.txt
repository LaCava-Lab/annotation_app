Introduction Mutations in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1) are the most common genetic cause of Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). PS1 mutations are likely to exert their pathophysiological effect by altering PS1/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), resulting in increased Aβ42/40 ratios. PSEN1 FAD patients are affected by early onset cognitive decline typical of AD, but additional symptoms are also present in patients with select FAD mutations. These include myoclonus and/or seizures, apraxia, dystonia, and behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. However, molecular mechanisms underlying these atypical symptoms are not fully understood. Previously, we and others reported that the β2-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Navβ2) is a substrate of BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase. We found that PS/γ-secretase–mediated cleavages of Navβ2 C-terminal fragments (β2-CTFs) released the intracellular domains of Navβ2 (β2-ICDs), which was localized to the nucleus and increased mRNA and protein levels of a Nav channel α-subunit, Nav1.1. These studies clearly demonstrate that PS/γ-secretase-mediated processing of Navβ2 plays a major role in regulating neuronal sodium channel Nav1.1. Since Nav1 channels play an important role in neural activity, here we tested if specific PS1 FAD mutations contribute to abnormal Nav1.1 levels by altering Navβ2 processing.

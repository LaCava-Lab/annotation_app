EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmids— Plasmid pCEFL-GST expresses GST fusion protein in mammalian cells. VRK1 full-length cDNA was subcloned in vector pCEFL-GST with restriction sites BamHI-BamHI. Plasmid pCEFL-GST-VRK2B was described previously. Plasmids pCEFL-HA-VRK1, pCEFL-HA-VRK2A, and pCEFL-HA-VRK2B express the human proteins tagged with an HA epitope. Different regions of VRK2 were also subcloned as fusion proteins in pCEFL-GST to produce clones pCEFL-GST-VRK2-N (1–320), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C1 (256–508), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C2 (364–508), and pCEFL-GST-VRK2B-C (256–397). Prokaryotic expression clones in plasmid pGEX-4T expressing GST-Ran (wild type), GST-RanL43E, and GST-RanT24N were from C. Walczak (Indiana University). Bacterial expression constructs 6xHisRCC1, 6xHisRCC1S2A, 6xHisRCC1S11A, and 6xHisRCC1S2,11A and mammalian expression construct RCC1-GFP were from Y. Zheng. The plasmid pGEX-GST-VRK1 expressing human GST-VRK1 fusion protein was described previously as were plasmids pGEX-GST-VRK2A and pGEX-GST-VRK2B expressing human GST-VRK2A and GST-VRK2B. 6xHisVRK1 construct was generated by subcloning VRK1 cDNA in pET23A vector (Novagen, Merck). VRK1 mammalian constructs pcDNA-VRK1-N-myc and pGFP-VRK1-C were described previously as were the VRK1 mutant pcDNA-VRK1 K179E-myc. The coding region of human VRK3 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using primers VRK3-R1 (5′-CCGAATTCATGATCTCCTTCTGTCCAGACTGTG-3′) and VRK3-NotI (5′-TTGCGGCCGCCTAGGGCACCATCGGGAGGCCAATG-3′) and cloned in the EcoRI-NotI restriction sites of vector pCEFL-HA generating plasmid pCEFL-HA-VRK3. Protein Expression and Purification— GST-Ran fusion proteins and GST-VRK1 were expressed in BL21DE3 cells and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) as reported previously, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C. In some cases, proteins were eluted using reduced glutathione at 10 or 20 mm. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). His-tagged proteins were expressed and purified with TALON Metal Affinity Resin (BD Biosciences) and eluted with 200 mm imidazole (Merck). Recombinant protein histone H3 was purchased from Upstate. Cell Culture and Transfections— The HEK293T and HeLa cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics (at 37 °C in 5% CO2). For transient transfections, 106 HEK293T cells were grown in P100 dishes and transfected 24 h later with the indicated amounts of plasmids with the jetPEI reagent (Polytransfection, Ilkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Purification of VRK-associated Proteins— For each transfection, a total of 5 × 107 HEK293T cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes. Cells were transiently transfected with pCEFL-GST-VRK1, pCEFL-GST-VRK2B, or pCEFL-GST using jetPEI reagent. Cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. After 30 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 12 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and subjected to 2D electrophoresis. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis— After the beads were washed, they were mixed with 250 μl of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 50 mm DTT, 5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 15 mg of DeStreak, and 0.5% IPG buffer), vortexed, incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, and centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 rpm. The supernatant was precipitated with methanol/chloroform, and finally the pellet was resuspended in rehydration buffer. The samples were applied to 13-cm IPG strips with a nonlinear pH gradient of 3–10 (Amersham Biosciences). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 50 V for 12 h, 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h, a voltage gradient ranging from 1000 to 8000 V for 30 min, and finally 5 h until the voltage reached 35,000 V. Strips were treated with SDS equilibration buffer (375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 20% glycerol, and 2% SDS) plus 2% DTT for 15 min for protein denaturation and after that with equilibration buffer plus 2.5% iodoacetamide for protein alkylation. The second dimension electrophoresis was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The protein spots were visualized with SYPRO Ruby protein gel staining. Spot Excision and Tryptic Digestion of Proteins— Spots of interest were excised automatically using a Proteineer spII robotic spot excision station (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). The digestion was performed as described previously with minor variations as follows: gel plugs were washed with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile and subsequently treated with 20 mm DTT in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 100 mm iodoacetamide in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Then the gel pieces were rinsed with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate plus acetonitrile and dried. Modified porcine trypsin, at a final concentration of 12 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate (Promega, Madison, WI), was added to the dry gel pieces and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Tryptic peptides were recovered and dried in a speed vacuum system and resuspended with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile in a final extraction volume of 5 μl. Mass Determination of Tryptic Peptides and Protein Identification— For MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting a 0.5-μl aliquot of matrix solution (5 g/liter 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was manually loaded onto a 400-μm-diameter AnchorChip™ target plate (Bruker Daltonics) probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then 1 μl of the above extraction solution was added and allowed to dry at room temperature. Samples were analyzed on a Bruker Daltonics Ultraflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The acquisition mass range was set to 680–4000 Da. The equipment was first externally calibrated using protonated mass signals from a standard peptide calibration mixture that contained seven peptides (Bruker Daltonics Peptide Calibration Standard 206196) covering the 1000–3200 m/z range, and thereafter every spectrum was internally calibrated using selected signals arising from trypsin autoproteolysis (842.510- and 2211.105-Da peptides) to reach a typical mass measurement accuracy of ±30 ppm. Each raw spectrum was opened in Bio Tools 2.1 (Bruker Daltonics) software and processed and analyzed by Xtof 5.1.1 software (Bruker Daltonics) using the following parameters: signal-to-noise threshold of 1, Savitzky-Golay algorithm for smoothing, tangential algorithm for base-line substraction, and centroid algorithm for monoisotopic peak assignment. In all cases, resolution was higher than 9000. All known contaminants (trypsin autoproteolysis and known keratin peaks) were excluded during the process. The generated peak lists were copied to the Mascot server (version 2.0, January 2004) and searched against the Swiss-Prot database (February 22, 2006; 207,132 sequence entries for Fig. 1 or October 11, 2006; 234,112 sequence entries for supplemental Fig. S1). Search parameters were set as follows: searches were restricted to Homo sapiens sequences (13,484 sequences for Fig. 1 or 14,780 for supplemental Fig. S1), up to one missed tryptic cleavage, mass accuracy of 100 ppm, MH+ monoisotopic masses, carbamidomethylcysteine as fixed modification, and methionine oxidation as variable modification. Mowse scores with a value greater than 54 were considered as significant (p < 0.05). Western Blot Analysis, GST Pulldown Assays, Immunoprecipitation, and Antibodies— Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and lysed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors). 25 μg of total protein lysate were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels to check protein expression. For GST pulldown assays, cells were lysed with lysis buffer, and a total of 1 mg of total cell extract or the amount of cells specified were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads or with the corresponding GST fusion protein for 2–12 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For endogenous VRK1 or Ran immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) 48 h after seeding. Clarified cell lysates were subjected to Ran immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody or to VRK1 immunoprecipitation with VE1 and VC1 polyclonal antibodies at 4 °C for several hours followed by incubation with γ-Bind beads (GE Healthcare) overnight. Beads were extensively washed with immunoprecipitation buffer, processed with Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Human VRK1 protein was detected with monoclonal 1F6 or polyclonal VE1 antibody. Human VRK2 proteins were detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognized both isoforms. GST was identified with the monoclonal antibody B14 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Ran was detected with monoclonal clone 20 (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen). RCC1 was detected with N19 anti-goat polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The HA epitope was detected with a specific monoclonal antibody from Covance (San Francisco, CA). The secondary antibodies used for Western blots anti-(mouse-HRP), anti-(rabbit-HRP) or anti-(goat-HRP) were from GE Healthcare. Luminescence in Western blot was developed with an ECL kit (GE Healthcare). In Vitro Interaction Assay— In vitro binding assays were carried out with purified proteins at the indicated concentrations in 250 μl of MgCl2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Where specified, nucleotides or EDTA were added at 2 mm to perform the loading of nucleotides to Ran fusion proteins. The loading was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a final volume of 50 μl before diluting to 250 μl in MgCl2 buffer. To perform the in vitro binding assays, proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. GST-tagged proteins and interacting partners were precipitated by addition of 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed four times with MgCl2 buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies. VRK1 Kinase Assay— VRK1 kinase activity was determined by assaying protein phosphorylation in a final volume of 30 μl containing kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 150 mm KCl), 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with 1 μg of GST-VRK1, GST-VRK2A, or GST-VRK2B protein and the indicated amounts of another proteins as substrates or cofactors. In all assays, the amount of recombinant histone H3 used as substrate was 1 μg. To perform immunocomplex kinase assays, VRK1 was immunoprecipitated from HEK293T cells as described above. The reactions were routinely performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer. In all cases, GST-VRK proteins or immunoprecipitated VRK1 was incubated previously with GST-Ran purified proteins or with buffer only 1 h at 4 °C to allow the interaction before starting the phosphorylation reactions. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Merck) or transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore), and the incorporated radioactivity was measured using a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). To detect specific phosphorylated residues of histone H3, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and immunoblotted with anti-phosphohistone H3 Thr-3 and Ser-10 antibodies (Upstate). When indicated, membranes were stained with Ponceau stain. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy— HeLa or HEK293T cells were plated on 60-mm dishes containing poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips. 24 or 48 h later, the slides were collected, and cells were fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min at −20 °C. A 1% bovine serum albumin solution in NaCl/Pi was used to block the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Endogenous Ran and VRK1 (or VRK2) were detected by consecutive immunostaining with the specific antibodies described above diluted in blocking solution. Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with each primary antibody and then with a mixture of the secondary antibodies, goat anti-mouse Cy2-labeled (GE Healthcare) and goat anti-rabbit Cy3-labeled (GE Healthcare), for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Gelvatol (Monsanto) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. GDP Unloading/GTP Loading Assays— For GDP release assays, a stock for several reactions of Ran loaded with radioactive GDP was made. GST-Ran (1 nmol) in loading buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 6 mm EDTA) was incubated with 0.185 MBq of [3H]GDP (5 μCi) (GE Healthcare TRK 335) in a final volume of 50 μl for 30 min at 24 °C. To stabilize the bound nucleotide, the protein was diluted with 450 μl of loading buffer containing 20 mm MgCl2, and the dilution was stored in ice. In each reaction, 50 pmol of loaded Ran (25 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of reaction mixture. Reaction mixtures contained RCC1 and VRK1 in exchange buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) to give final protein concentrations indicated in the figures and free unlabeled GTP for exchange in a final concentration of 2 mm. In all cases, loaded Ran was incubated previously for 15 min at 24 °C with the indicated amount of VRK1 in exchange buffer or with exchange buffer only in reactions without VRK1 to allow the interaction. Then RCC1 and free GTP were added, and the final reaction mixture was incubated for 5 min at 24 °C to perform the GDP release assay. To stop the reaction, samples were added to 2 ml of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) and immediately filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). The filters were washed with 20 ml of stop buffer, transferred to vials, and dissolved with 1 ml of 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma). Radioactivity that remained bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the results are shown as mean values with error bars indicating the S.E. For GTP binding assays, the same protocol was performed with the following variations: GST-Ran was loaded with 0.1 μmol of unlabeled GDP, and 0.007 μm (0.35 μl of) free 35S-GTP (GE Healthcare SJ-1320) was used for exchange in each reaction. The incorporated radioactivity was measured at the indicated times in the figures.

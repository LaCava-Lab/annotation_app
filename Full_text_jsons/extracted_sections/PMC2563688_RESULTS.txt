Results Assessment of inflammation and PDE4 activity at day 6 Inflammatory-cell count in BAL fluid On day 6 of life, hyperoxia increased 2.5 times the total number of inflammatory cells in BAL (ANOVA p<0.05), and induced a preferential recruitment of neutrophils that were increased 10 times as compared with control group (ANOVA p<0.001). The trend of macrophages to increase slightly was not significant (Figure 1). Rolipram had no effect on inflammatory-cell count under air condition but prevented totally the hyperoxia-induced increase in total cell number (p<0.01), and prevented partly the neutrophil increase (p<0.01). Chemokine and cytokines Overall, the expression levels of the studied cytokines, considering either mRNAs or proteins, were different among all groups (p<0.01 for each parameter by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). On day 6 of life, hyperoxia induced a huge increase in the protein and mRNA concentrations of IL6, MCP-1, and OPN (Figures 2–3, p<0.05 to p<0.01 by Mann-Whitney U test depending of the parameter). Rolipram administration under air condition affected the protein or mRNA concentrations of none of these factors. By contrast, it prevented the increase of MCP-1 and OPN proteins under hyperoxia (p<0.01 between groups O2-diluent and O2-rolipram for both). As regards IL-6, the decrease of protein level did not reach significance (p = 0.08). Rolipram diminished the OPN mRNA level only under hyperoxia (p<0.05 between groups O2-rolipram and O2-diluent), although this was nevertheless higher than in the control group (p<0.01 between groups air-diluent and O2-rolipram). PDE4 activity and expression On day 6 of life, whole-lung PDE4 activity was significantly different among all groups (p<0.05 by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). PDE4 activity tended to be higher in the O2-diluent group as compared with the air-diluent group, although this did not reach significance (p = 0.08) (Figure 4). Treatment with rolipram had no effect on PDE4 activity in normoxia, whereas it decreased it under hyperoxia (p<0.05). PDE4 family is encoded by four genes designated A through D. Whereas PDE4C is absent from adult lungs, PDE4A, 4B, and PDE4D RNAs are expressed in lungs. Immunoblotting with antibodies raised against PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D proteins evidenced only a slight increase of the immunosignal of a PDE4B band with an apparent molecular weight of 72 kDa (insert in Figure 4). Assessment of survival, growth and alveolarization at day 10 Survival Overall, differences among all groups were significant (p<0.001 by Logrank). In keeping with previous studies, hyperoxia induced high mortality, mainly on days 5 and 6 of exposure, reaching 70% in the O2-diluent group (Figure 5). Rolipram reduced hyperoxia-induced mortality to 17%, (p<0.05 between rolipram-treated and diluent-treated groups in hyperoxia). The differences in survival between rat pups treated by rolipram under hyperoxia and those under air and receiving either rolipram or its diluent were not significant. Body-weight gain Gain in body weight was different among all groups (p<0.001 by ANOVA). Hyperoxia impaired weight gain of pups all over the 10 first days of life (Figure 6). Rolipram administration decreased weight gain either under hyperoxia or normoxia in the same proportions. The decrease induced by rolipram was larger than that consecutive to hyperoxia exposure, the day-10 body weight being decreased about one third. Lung Morphometry Gross light-microscopy evaluation of 10-day-old rat lungs suggested that hyperoxia induced enlargement of alveoli, in the diluent-treated as well as in the rolipram-treated groups (Figure 7). Alveoli appeared also underdeveloped in the air-rolipram group. The results of morphometric analysis are summarized in Table 1.  Lung volume: overall, lung volume and specific lung volume were different among all groups (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively, by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). Hyperoxia decreased lung volume in pups treated by rolipram as well as in those receiving the diluent (p<0.05 for each by Mann-Whitney U test), but did not alter specific lung volume. Rolipram had no effect on absolute lung volume, but increased specific lung volume (p<0.01) either under hyperoxia or air (p<0.01).  Alveolar surface: overall, alveolar-surface density, absolute and specific alveolar-surface areas were significantly different among all groups (p<0.001 for both by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). As expected, hyperoxia decreased drastically the alveolar surface density by 33%, as well as the absolute and specific surface areas by 44% and 37%, respectively (p<0.01 for rolipram- and diluent-treated pups). Rolipram had no effect on alveolar-surface area density but decreased absolute alveolar-surface area in air-exposed pups by 17% (p<0.05) and by 22%, in O2-exposed pups, although this effect did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Rolipram increased specific alveolar-surface area by 20% in air-exposed pups (p<0.01), and by 22% in those under hyperoxia (p<0.05) as compared to O2-diluent group, but this value remained lower than in groups under air (p<0.05).  Parenchymal alveolar volume: overall, the differences were not significant for volume density but were significant for absolute and specific values between groups (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). Absolute values were decreased by hyperoxia in both diluent (by 19%) and rolipram groups (by 14%) (p<0.05 for each), but rolipram had by itself no effect on absolute volume, neither in air nor under hyperoxia. Hyperoxia altered specific parenchymal volume neither in rolipram nor in diluent groups. Rolipram increased specific values under hyperoxia by 38% and in air by 49% (p<0.01 for each).  Radial alveolar count (RAC): overall, differences were significant for RAC among groups (p<0.01). Hyperoxia decreased significantly RAC in diluent-treated pups by 49% (p<0.01) and in rolipram-treated pups by 35% (p<0.05). Rolipram decreased RAC in air-exposed pups by 35% (p<0.01), but induced no further change in hyperoxia-exposed pups.

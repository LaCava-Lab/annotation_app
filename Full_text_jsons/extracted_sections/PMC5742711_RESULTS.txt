Results Retinal levels of AQP4, VEGF, HIF‐1α, iNOS and NO In line with previous findings 8, we found that AQP4 was upregulated by 5 days of relative hypoxia (PD17). Levels of AQP4 mRNA and proteins were about 115% and 126% (P < 0.01) higher than in normoxic controls (Fig. 1). Whether AQP4 deletion affects retinal levels of VEGF, HIF‐1α, iNOS and NO in response to hypoxia was investigated. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, normoxic levels of VEGF mRNA (Fig. 2A), VEGF proteins (Fig. 2B and C), HIF‐1α proteins (Fig. 2D), iNOS proteins (Fig. 3A) and NO production (Fig. 3B) did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice. Hypoxia increased VEGF mRNA by about 200% in respect to normoxia in WT mice (P < 0.001) and by about 96% in AQP4 KO mice (P < 0.01). VEGF proteins as evaluated by Western blot were drastically increased by hypoxia (about 130% in WT mice, P < 0.001 and about 70% in AQP4 KO mice, P < 0.01). As evaluated by ELISA, hypoxia increased VEGF levels (about 450% in WT mice, P < 0.001 and about 160% in AQP4 KO mice, P < 0.01). Figure 2D shows that hypoxia increased HIF‐1α proteins by about 225% in WT mice (P < 0.01) and by about 735% in AQP4 KO mice (P < 0.001). We checked whether increased HIF‐1α accumulation in the absence of AQP4 might depend on an impaired migration of HIF‐1α from the cytosol to the nucleus. Representative blots depicting cytosolic and nuclear HIF‐1α are shown in Figure 2E. The densitometric analysis of Figure 2F demonstrates that the ratios between nuclear and cytosolic levels of HIF‐1α did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice. Measurements of iNOS proteins and NO production in response to hypoxia shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that iNOS increased by about 70% in WT mice (P < 0.01), whereas it was not influenced by hypoxia in AQP4 KO mice. Consistently, hypoxia increased NO production by about 110% (P < 0.001) in WT mice, while no effects were found in AQP4 KO mice. Retinal vasculature The vascular pattern of normoxic retinas did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice (Fig. 4A and C). In WT mice, the vascular pattern of the hypoxic retina was consistent with previous results 22 and was characterized by a large avascular area in the central retina and an excessive regrowth of abnormal superficial vessels in the mid‐peripheral retina (Fig. 4B). In AQP4 KO mice, instead, the superficial plexus exhibited only rare neovascular tufts without any apparent difference in the extent of the avascular area (Fig. 4D). The quantitative analysis confirmed that AQP4 deletion did not affect the avascular area (Fig. 4E), whereas it reduced significantly the area occupied by neovascular tufts (about 80%, P < 0.001; Fig. 4F). ERG responses Representative mixed a‐, b‐waves and OPs recorded in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in WT or AQP4 KO mice are shown in Figure 5A. Increased a‐ and b‐wave amplitudes with increasing stimulus intensity were observed (Fig. 5B and C). A clear a‐wave developed at a light intensity of approximately −1.6 log cd‐s/m2. In normoxia, WT and AQP4 KO mice had comparable ERG responses. In response to hypoxia, WT mice displayed reduced a‐ and b‐wave amplitudes in respect to normoxia at all light intensities (P < 0.001). In contrast, AQP4 KO mice displayed an a‐ and b‐wave amplitudes which did not differ from those measured in normoxia. The amplitudes of b‐waves obtained over varying flash light intensities were fitted using the Naka‐Rushton equation to evaluate the post‐receptor response amplitude (Vmax) and the retinal sensitivity (k). As shown in Table 3, in OIR WT mice, the values of Vmax and k were significantly lower than in normoxia (P < 0.001), whereas in AQP4 KO mice, the values of Vmax and k were not significantly different from those in normoxia. As shown in Figure 5D, summed OP amplitudes (SOPs) were averaged as a function of increasing light intensities. In normoxia, both WT and AQP4 KO mice displayed increased SOPs with increasing stimulus intensity. In hypoxia, WT mice were characterized by SOPs reduction at all light intensities (P < 0. 001). In AQP4 KO mice, SOPs did not differ significantly from those measured in normoxia. DNA methylation analysis of the VEGF gene promoter: focus on the HBS We investigated in retinas from AQP4 KO mice whether the lower VEGF accumulation in response to hypoxia might be associated with changes in the CpG methylation status in the VEGF gene promoter. In a first set of experiments, direct PCR bisulphite sequencing was used to analyse the methylation status of 23 CpG sites in 4 DNA regions belonging to the VEGF promoter and the 5′ UTR. In particular, we analysed 11 single CpG sites, including the CpG site contained in the HBS 41 (CpG1), as well as 12 CpG sites contained in a 5′UTR CpG island. Figure 6A shows that after 5 days of hypoxia (PD17), 4 CpG sites (CpG1 in the HBS and three other nearby CpG sites, CpG2, CpG3 and CpG4) were methylated in both WT and AQP4 KO mice, while the CpG sites in the remaining DNA regions were almost completely demethylated in the two strains. In Figure 6B, the chromatograms that are representative of the methylation status of CpG1‐4 are shown. It can be noticed that the methylation status of CpG1‐4 did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice with CpG3 that was methylated in both normoxia and hypoxia, while CpG1, 2 and 4 that were demethylated in normoxia, but methylated in hypoxia. This finding demonstrates that at PD17, there was no difference in the methylation status between WT and AQP4 KO mice although, in the absence of AQP4, mRNA levels of VEGF were lower than in its presence. Considering that HBS demethylation is required to allow HIF‐1α interaction with the HBS 27, that this interaction should precede VEGF production 41 and that retinal levels of HIF‐1α and VEGF are maximally upregulated in response to hypoxia over the first hours after the hypoxia onset 23, we can reasonably assume that in the OIR model, the interaction between HIF‐1 and the HBS should take place rapidly during the hypoxic response. In a first set of experiments, we evaluated VEGF expression at different times after the beginning of hypoxia in WT and AQP4 KO mice. We found that at 1 hr of hypoxia, the levels of VEGF mRNA were significantly lower than in normoxia. VEGF mRNA reached normoxic levels after 6 hrs of hypoxia to drastically increase at 12 hrs after then they were reduced by about 50%. We found that compared to the WT the absence of AQP4 had already reduced VEGF mRNA levels after 12 hrs of hypoxia when the VEGF accumulation was maximal (Fig. 7A). To test the possibility that hypoxia rapidly influences the methylation status of the HBS and to evaluate the effect of AQP4 absence, we investigated the methylation status of CpG1 after 1 hr of hypoxia. As shown in Figure 7B, in response to 1 hr of hypoxia, CpG1 was indeed demethlyated in WT mice, whereas it was methylated in AQP4 KO mice similarly to what found in both WT and AQP4 KO mice under normoxia. The COBRA analysis revealed that after 1 hr of hypoxia, the methylation frequency of CpG1 was about 30% lower in WT than in AQP4 KO mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 7C). An additional quantification of the methylation frequency of CpG1‐4 in the VEGF promoter was performed using the most accurate technique of cloning and sequencing of bisulphite‐treated DNA. Figure 7D shows that the methylation frequency of CpG1 in the HBS was about twofold lower in WT than in AQP4 KO mice (36% in WT versus 73% in AQP4 KO mice). Similarly, the methylation frequency of CpG2 is about 28% in WT and 54% in AQP4 KO mice. In contrast, CpG3 was almost completely methylated, and CpG4 strongly demethylated, in both WT and AQP4 KO mice without any difference between the two strains. Analysis of physical interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS of the VEGF gene promoter in OIR To test whether the different methylation frequency of the CpG1 in the HBS measured in hypoxia was associated to a different physical interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS, retinas of WT and AQP4 KO mice were analysed at PD12 after 1 and 6 hrs of hypoxia and at PD17 by HIF‐1α‐specific chromatin immunoprecipitation and HBS‐specific qPCR (ChIP‐qPCR). Due to the very low level of HIF‐1α measured in normoxia (Fig. 2D) and due to the almost absent interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS occurring in normoxia already reported in the literature 42, the ChIP‐qPCR analysis was here restricted to the hypoxic condition by comparing WT with AQP4 KO mice. As shown in Figure 7E, in WT mice, the interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS started quickly (in the first hour) and peaked after 6 hrs of hypoxia, whereas it had returned to levels measured after 1 hr of hypoxia at PD17. In AQP4 KO mice, the interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS was lower than in WT mice: three times after 1 hr of hypoxia or at PD17 and six times after 6 hrs of hypoxia.

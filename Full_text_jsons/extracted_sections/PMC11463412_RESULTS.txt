Results Purification of an allelic series of full-length HTT protein samples Previously, we designed and developed an open-source toolkit for the eukaryotic expression and purification of full-length HTT proteins with different polyQ tract lengths and N- or C-terminal FLAG tags for purification and/or detection. This toolkit is a unique resource for HD research as it encompasses a fine-grain allelic series of HTT proteins corresponding to wildtype control (Q23, Q25, Q30), HD threshold inflection point (Q36), adult-onset HD (Q42, Q52, Q54) and juvenile-onset HD (Q60, Q66). Regardless of polyQ tract length, all proteins can be co-expressed with HAP40, an important interaction partner of HTT whose levels track with HTT in cells and which functions to stabilize the large HTT protein molecule. All HTT proteins were purified from insect cells using a two-step protocol, FLAG-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and verified by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1). We have previously validated HTT and HTT-HAP40 samples produced using this toolkit with numerous biophysical and structural methodologies to show they are pure, monodisperse, folded and functional samples amenable to downstream interrogation. We further complemented this suite of HTT proteins with mHTT fragment proteins described previously, to ensure better coverage of the milieu of mHTT species which are present in patient and HD animal model biofluid samples. The fragment proteins included a construct spanning aa. 1-171 with Q68 fused to aa. 1744-2234, hereafter called fusion HTT Q68, and aa. 1-586 with Q68, hereafter called N586 HTT Q68. HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay for ultrasensitive detection of HTT shows that protein concentration and polyQ tract length influence assay signal To measure the signal elicited from our panel of HTT proteins under different conditions, we used a micro-bead-based immunoprecipitation-flow cytometry (IP-FCM) assay. This assay was previously optimized, and a capture-probe antibody pair were identified which permit ultrasensitive detection of mHTT in HD mouse model and patient CSF (Figure 1A). Our IP-FCM assay employs the HDB4E10 antibody (hereafter HDB4), which was raised against an epitope within the bridge domain aa. 1844-2131 of HTT and also recognizes an epitope in exon 1 (Supplementary Figure 2), and the polyQ-specific MW1 antibody which is employed in other published mHTT detection assays. Assay signal from our HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay and a different ultrasensitive mHTT detection assay also suitable for use in CSF that employs Singulex technology, showed statistically significant correlation of mHTT assay signal (Figure 1B). Analysis of a titration of our allelic series of purified full-length HTT samples using the IP-FCM assay reveals that assay signal is modulated by polyQ length as well as concentration, with greater assay signal measured for higher protein concentrations and longer polyQ tract lengths (Figure 2A). Replotting these data as a function of polyQ tract length shows that the relationship between polyQ length and assay signal at a defined protein concentration is approximately linear under the conditions tested (Figure 2B). Different structural properties of the HTT protein can influence IP-FCM assay signal Next, we investigated how different structural features of the HTT protein might influence HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay signal. Beyond polyQ tract length, HTT proteoform heterogeneity in HD patient CSF is expected due to alternatively spliced fragments, or fragmentation due to proteolytic cleavage, as well as aggregation of the protein into higher order oligomers. Recombinant proteins used as standards can also differ by the position of their purification tags which can further modulate their structure and/or conformation. Using a suite of HTT proteins, we investigated these variables. Firstly, full-length and fragment HTT proteins bearing approximately the same polyQ tract were assessed using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay, revealing significantly different profiles for each protein over equivalent concentration titrations (Figure 3A). Despite all three proteins containing approximately the same polyQ-tract length, the assay signal is influenced by the context of these epitopes with the greatest signal observed in the full-length protein, potentially due to conformational flexibility and/or other structural changes that different epitope flanking sequences confer to the protein molecule. Next, we assessed full-length HTT proteins, with either N- or C-terminal FLAG tags and polyQ tract lengths of Q23 or Q66 using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay (Figure 3B). For HTT Q66, proteins bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag compared to an N-terminal FLAG tag show lower assay signal. A similar trend is also seen for HTT Q23 at higher concentrations of protein, with N-terminally tagged HTT Q23 eliciting higher assay signal that C-terminally tagged HTT Q23. This finding suggests that affinity tag positioning can alter the accessibility or conformation of antibody epitopes. Indeed, the MW1 epitope begins just 17 residues after the N-terminal tag and flanking sequence composition is known to influence the biophysical properties of the polyQ tract. We then looked at the effects of HTT protein oligomerization and aggregation on IP-FCM assay signal. The gel filtration elution profile of apo HTT has a distinct shape, reported by multiple groups. The main peak corresponding to monomeric HTT eluting after ~0.6 column volumes preceded by dimer, tetramer and increasingly higher order oligomer peaks eluting ahead of the monomer peak, with the largest oligomers and aggregates eluting in the column void volume (~0.3 column volumes). FLAG-affinity chromatography purified HTT Q54 (~85% pure) was concentrated (input) (Figure 3C, middle) and applied to Superose6 Increase 10/300 column, then we collected eight 1 mL fractions spanning all peaks (fractions 1-8) (Figure 3C, left). The concentration of the eight gel filtration fractions and input sample was normalised and then samples of each analysed by HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay at different dilutions (Figure 3C, right). Fractions corresponding to mHTT monomer yielded the lowest signal in this assay (F6-8), with signal increasing as oligomeric state increased to the largest assemblies (F1). The change in assay signal with oligomeric state might reflect avidity effects occurring in higher order assemblies of HTT protein, where adjacent epitopes across protein molecules are more likely to be in closer proximity, as is reported for other aggregate protein immunoassays. IP-FCM assay buffer can influence assay signal for some HTT protein complexes HTT is a protein scaffold and is reported to bind more than 500 proteins. Because of the varying interaction interfaces and conformational changes induced by complex formation, we hypothesised that different protein complexes of HTT are likely to have altered epitope availability. HAP40 is the only structurally validated interaction partner of HTT and can bind HTT with either wildtype (Q23) or disease expanded (Q54) polyQ tract lengths. Assay buffer components, such as detergents, can influence protein complex structure and stability. Performing our IP-FCM assay with a buffer more closely resembling physiological conditions, such as artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (Figure 4A), a difference in assay signal can be observed for apo compared to HAP40-bound forms of HTT for the Q54 form of the protein (p<0.0001 for all concentrations, 2way ANOVA multiple comparisons of log-log data) but not Q23, indicating that expanded exon 1 might be differently structured in these two proteoforms of HTT. However, when the assay is performed under more stringent buffer conditions, such as with the detergent NP-40 (1% (v/v/)) (Figure 4B), this difference in signal is lost. This could be due to NP-40-mediated disruption of the HTT-HAP40 complex itself or conformational uniformity of exon 1 structure for apo and HAP40-bound HTT in the presence of detergent. Next, we compared the assay signal obtained from human CSF samples diluted 1:1 in either aCSF or a buffer containing NP-40 detergent (Figure 4C). Although samples with relatively low assay signal gave comparable signal in both buffer conditions, as shown by their proximity to the X=Y line, those with higher mHTT concentration as denoted by higher assay signal showed much higher signal in NP-40 buffer compared to aCSF. Again, this indicates that detergent in assay buffer can modulate epitope availability and binding by the HDB4/MW1 antibody pair in the IP-FCM assay format, perhaps related to changes in HTT complex formation, conformation or structure under different buffer conditions. MW1 has preference but not specificity for mHTT and can deplete wildtype HTT The MW1 antibody is also used to pretreat samples for analysis in ultrasensitive wildtype HTT detection assays, with the aim of depleting biofluid samples of mHTT, leaving only wildtype HTT to be detected with polyQ length-independent immunoassay antibody pair. However, our HTT allelic series IP-FCM data (Figure 2) show that MW1 has only preference, not specificity for mHTT, suggesting that such an assay approach may also deplete wildtype HTT. This corroborates previously studies which drew the same conclusion. We conducted a parallel experiment with Hu97/18 mouse CSF depleted using MW1 and assessed the depleted CSF and MW1 IP fraction using HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM. The depleted CSF shows reduced signal in the assay compared to the sample obtained by MW1 IP (Figure 5B). This finding confirms that MW1 binds both HTT Q18 and Q97 in this experiment, and binding preference, but not complete specificity is shown by MW1 to mHTT. The degree to which each form of HTT is depleted from a biofluid samples likely depends on the relative affinity of MW1 for the specific polyQ tract lengths of the HTT proteins in question, as well as avidity effects, which will be driven by the relative concentrations of the proteins and the MW1 antibody in the depletion experiment conditions. To test this hypothesis, we first used MW1 in an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment with Hu97/18 HD model mouse brain lysates. Hu97/18 mice express full-length human HTT Q97 and Q18 and lack mouse Hdh (Figure 5A). Analysis of the input, flow through and IP fraction using a western blot that separates wildtype and mHTT bands, shows that the mHTT protein is diminished in the flow through fraction compared to input, though not completely depleted, and that both forms of the protein are present in the elution. The affinity of MW1 for HTT is influenced by polyQ length To further investigate MW1 binding to our full-length HTT allelic series, we used two orthogonal assays to measure MW1 interaction with different polyQ length HTT proteins. MW1-HTT binding was analysed under native and denatured conditions using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis respectively. For ELISA, HTT was adhered to the plate surface and a titration of MW1 antibody was incubated prior to detection with HRP-linked secondary antibody as previously described. The MW1 titration was optimised to ensure binding saturation as seen by stabilised A450 readings as MW1 concentration increases (Figure 6A). This permitted calculation of binding affinities of MW1 for each HTT protein, reported as apparent KD values (Kapp)(Figure 6B), as the stoichiometry of binding complex for each polyQ tract length is unknown and varies as a function of the levels of HTT immobilised on the plate surface. In this assay, A450 values change as a function of MW1 concentration and polyQ tract length. This finding parallels our earlier observations of small Q-length changes influencing immunoassay signal in our IP-FCM analysis (Figure 2). We observe that Kapp decreases exponentially with polyQ tract length indicating increasingly high affinity binding to longer polyQ tract length HTT proteins. This indicates that, in solution, MW1 binds HTT in a polyQ tract length dependent manner, as others have shown before, but also highlights how MW1 only has preference for mHTT and is not specific for HTT species with polyQ tracts above the disease threshold length. To understand if this finding for MW1-epitope interaction is specific to HTT, we next investigated another polyQ tract containing protein, ataxin-3. Using two different polyQ length ataxin-3 proteins, we repeated the ELISA protocol with ataxin-3 Q10 or Q80 adhered to the plate this time. We observe the same pattern for these two proteins with A450 maximal signal greatly increased for Q80 vs Q10 and the calculated Kapp values much lower for Q80 than Q10, indicating much tighter binding (Supplementary Figure 3). In our western blot analysis of the full-length HTT allelic series, approximately equal amounts of each HTT protein were analysed by western blot, probing with MW1 and also EPR5526, a polyQ independent antibody which targets another region of the exon 1 sequence. Similar to our ELISA experiments, we observed polyQ tract length dependent binding of MW1 (Figure 6C) with only faint bands observed for HTT proteins with wildtype polyQ tract lengths. Calculating the normalised signal ratio of MW1/EPR5526, we observe an inflection point ~Q36 with stabilised signal ratio for HTT proteins with polyQ tract >42. Together, this further validates our conclusion that MW1 interaction with HTT is polyQ length driven but not specific for mHTT (Figure 6D).

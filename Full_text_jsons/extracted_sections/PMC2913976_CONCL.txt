CONCLUSIONS In this work, we have simulated the binding of PAR2 extracellular ectodomain by the FVIIa protease domain through molecular modeling and a 4-ns implicit-solvent molecular dynamics followed by a 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. These simulations maintain the transition-state interactions of the serine protease catalytic site with the substrate and reveal the molecular interactions that can facilitate PAR2-FVIIa binding. They also identify folded regions of the PAR 2 ectodomain that constrain the distance between the cell membrane and the activation cleavage site. The derived model thus implies that the TF-FVIIa complex must be tilted towards cell membrane in order to access and cleave the PAR2 extracellular tail.

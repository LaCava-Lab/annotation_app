6. Results FRET between LSS-mOrange and mKate2 will cause the higher-energy donor fluorescent protein (LSS-mOrange) to have a shorter fluorescence lifetime. Energy transfer between these two molecules will occur if they are spatially close to one another, as shown in the intact reporter construct. Once the DEVD sequence has been cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, the LSS-mOrange and mKate2 FRET pair spatially separate. Separation of these proteins minimizes energy transfer from LSS-mOrange to mKate-2 and increases the donorâ€™s lifetime (Figure 1).  In Protocols 2 and 4, we discuss multiple experimental setups and imaging protocols, respectively. We expect the LSS-mOrange control cells to display a longer fluorescence lifetime than cells expressing fused LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 due to the lack of energy being transferred from the donor protein. Any treatment that causes apoptotic cell death will display an increased fraction of cells with a longer lifetime of LSS-mOrange due to cleavage at DEVD sites. The shift to the longer lifetime of LSS-mOrange occurs in 2D environments with increasing amounts of BAX-encoding plasmid, decreasing the availability of essential nutrients, and treating with different concentrations of pro-apoptotic drugs (Figure 2). The 3D spheroid and murine models will also display the same patterns; groups treated with trametinib will display increased apoptosis over their vehicle control. Protocol 3 details how to perform a metabolic flux assay on cells used in the FLIM studies. We used the commercially available metabolic flux assay and glucose stress test along with the Seahorse Bioscience XFe analyzer. These data can be correlated with a 2D nutrient deprivation study and subsequent FLIM imaging of the LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 reporter. Metabolically active cells with increased rates of both oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification will display less apoptotic cell death. Future implications of this technology include screening for compounds that induce cellular apoptosis in cancer cells. While cells in 2D environments may present with morphological changes when beginning to undergo apoptosis, it is more difficult to visualize these changes in cells in 3D environments. The usefulness of FRET apoptosis reporter constructs is highlighted by the recent use of a similar construct to detect caspase-3 activation in a mouse xenograft model. This reporter allows for efficient screening of apoptosis in complex environments and we have previously used this reporter to quantify apoptosis in 3D and mouse models of breast cancer.

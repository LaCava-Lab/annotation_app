Results Nineteen MF patients were enrolled in the study and profiled for the spike-specific antibody and memory B cell responses following administration of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. All subjects received Spikevax mRNA-1273 for the first vaccination cycle, and Spikevax mRNA-1273 (17 patients) or Comirnaty-BNT16b2b (2 patients) for the third dose. The median age of this cohort was 72 years (range 44-88 years), 8 were male (42%) and 11 were female (58%). A cohort of 20 age and sex-matching healthy controls (HC) was included in the study ( Table 1 ). At the time of the first vaccination 8 out of 19 MF patients (42%) were treated with ruxolitinib while 11 (58%) were on supportive care and/or HU only. Complete clinical characteristics of MF patients are summarized in  Table 2 . Of note, a patient (#583) in therapy with ruxolitinib had a concomitant treatment with ibrutinib for a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( Table S1 ). A schematic representation of the study design is reported in  Figure 1 . Spike-specific antibody response and ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity The induction and persistence of circulating spike-specific IgG was monitored following the second and the third vaccine dose ( Figures 2A, B ). Plasma levels of anti-spike IgG, tested 30 days after the second vaccine dose in MF patients, were not significantly different compared to HC regardless of ruxolitinib treatment, with GMT of 4238 in MF-Ruxo (95% CI 1134 to 15843; range 160-40960), 3948 in MF+Ruxo (95% CI 1487 to 10482; range 640-20480) and 9891 in HC (95% CI 6721 to 14556; range 1280-40960;  Figure 2A ). The third vaccine dose significantly boosted the anti-spike IgG response, reaching antibody levels with GMT of 23231 in MF-Ruxo (95% CI 6455 to 83608; range 640-163840; P<0.01), 10240 in MF+Ruxo (95% CI 3845 to 27271; range 1280-40960) and 147661 in HC (95% CI 118783 to 183559; range 81920-327680; P<0.001,  Figure 2A ). However, the anti-spike IgG titers elicited were significantly lower in MF patients, regardless of ruxolitinib treatment, compared to HCs (P<0.01,  Figures 2A, B ). A significant increase of anti-spike IgG was observed for all groups after the second and the third vaccine dose compared to the baseline (P<0.05,  Figure 2A ). Based on the threshold indicated by the WHO for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and confirmed for SARS-CoV-2, indicating antibody seroconversion with an increase > 4 respect to the baseline, the number of MF subjects showing a seroconversion of anti-spike IgG was 15/19 (79%) after the second vaccine dose (GMT of 3950, 95% CI 1842 to 8474; range 160-40960) and 17/19 (89%) after the third dose (GMT of 17199, 95% CI 7804 to 37903; range 640-163840). Plasma samples collected before vaccination and after the second and the third vaccine dose were tested for their ability of blocking the interaction between RBD and ACE-2 receptor, employing a surrogate virus neutralization assay. Among MF patients, antibodies with a positive ACE2-RBD inhibition activity [value ≥30%, as reported in ] were observed in 45.5% of subjects without treatment (5/11; P≤0.01 vs HCs) and in 50% of Ruxo-treated MF patients (4/8) after the second vaccine dose ( Figure 2D ). After the third dose, ACE2-RBD inhibition activity was observed in 88% (7/8) of Ruxo-treated and 82% (9/11) of untreated MF patients, with a significant increase compared to post v2 ( Figure 2D ). Healthy subjects positive for ACE2-RBD inhibition were 98% post v2 (19/20) and 100% post v3 (20/20). Taken together, the booster dose administered to MF patients significantly increased the anti-spike IgG response compared to levels observed after the second dose, regardless of the ruxolitinib treatment, and strongly raised the percentage of patients with antibodies capable of inhibiting the ACE2/RBD binding (P<0.05). Compared to HC, the spike-specific antibody response in MF patients was however lower (P<0.05,  Figures 2C, D ). Spike-specific B cells generation The induction of the B cell response upon vaccination is characterized by the production of B cell subpopulations with different functionalities and phenotypes, according to the effector or memory phase of the immune response. Here, we characterized the spike-specific B cell response at the baseline (pre v1), 7 days after the second (post v2) and 15 days after the third (post v3) vaccination in MF patients and HC. SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells were identified using the full-spike protein and RBD as fluorescent probes, and their phenotype was characterized assessing the expression of CD19, CD20, IgD, CD27, CD38, molecules. Spike/RBD-specific cells were detected within the pool of not naïve CD19+ cells (hereafter named S+RBD+ B cells,  Figures 3A, B ). S+RBD+ B cells were elicited in blood of MF patients without ruxolitinib treatment after two vaccine doses (post v2) as shown in  Figures 3C, D , with a significantly lower percentage compared to HC group (frequency of 0.13% and 0.32%, respectively; P≤ 0.01). Undetectable SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells were instead observed in patients treated with ruxolitinib (0.01%). The third dose significantly boosted the SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell response in MF patients with an increase of S+RBD+ B cells to 0.30% and 0.28% in patients without or with ruxolitinib treatment, respectively (P≤0.05), stimulating a B cell response similar to that observed in HC ( Figures 3C, D ). The analysis of the spike+RBD+specific memory B cell response strongly highlights the crucial impact of the third dose on the improvement of the response to the COVID-19 vaccination in this cohort of fragile patients. Analysis of antibody and B cell response in individual MF patients The longitudinal profiling of the humoral and B cell responses in each patient following the second and third vaccine dose, subdividing patients with (n=8) or without (n=11) ruxolitinib treatment, is reported in  Figure 4 , while clinical parameters of each subject are summarized in  Table S1 . The time course analysis of anti-spike IgG clearly shows a two-fold increase in each individual following the third dose, except for patient #583 under ruxolitinib treatment ( Figure 4A ) and for patients #497 and #552 without ruxolitinib treatment ( Figure 4B ), which maintained a low antibody response also after the booster dose. Concomitantly, the three patients were negative for the ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity ( Figures 4C, D ) and did not develop a spike-specific B cell response ( Figures 4E, F ). Patient #583 was on ruxolitinib and ibrutinib treatment, as he is affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well. His lower immune responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can therefore be due to the immunosuppressive ibrutinib drug, that inhibits B-cell proliferation and survival. Patients #497 and #552, who received only HU or supportive therapy ( Table S1 ), have been treated with, or they were still receiving lymphodepleting therapies at the time of vaccination. In fact, patient #552 was treated for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma few years before, receiving six cycles of immunochemotherapy (R-COP) and a rituximab maintenance therapy, while patient #497 was on chronic therapy with methylprednisolone for fibromyalgia. In all the other patients, the third dose of mRNA vaccine considerably enhanced SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and B-cell responses, also in low responder subjects after the second dose (#523, #564, #525), independently of the ruxolitinib treatment. S+RBD+ B cells were observed in 7/8 (87%) ruxolitinib-treated and 7/11 (64%) untreated patients ( Figures 4E, F ).

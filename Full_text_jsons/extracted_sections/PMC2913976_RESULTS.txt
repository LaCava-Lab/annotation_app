RESULTS 1. FVIIa Catalytic Site The FVIIa catalytic site was carefully monitored throughout the simulations to ensure that the key interactions between the FVIIa catalytic site and PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 were maintained. In vivo, these interactions are directly involved in PAR2’s cleavage by FVIIa. In our simulations these known interactions were used to tether the remaining PAR2 polypeptide, helping to accelerate interactions with the FVIIa protease domain. Even though in vivo some parts of the PAR2 ectodomain may bind FVIIa before docking of the Arg36 P1 residue, the simulation (started with Arg36-Ser37 in place) serve as an efficient way of discovering the binding modes between the PAR2 ectodomain and the FVIIa protease domain. Simulations to derive the final binding mode without any PAR2 residues in place would be highly challenging with current simulation techniques and computational speeds. Figure 1 shows the FVIIa catalytic site after implicit-solvent energy minimization (Left) and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (Right). FVIIa’s Asp102, His57, and Ser195 form the catalytic triad, while the amines of Ser195 and Gly193 form the oxyanion hole hosting PAR2’s Arg36:O (based on Figure 11–27 of). FVIIa’s His57 should have a hydrogen on the delta nitrogen (ND1) but not on the epsilon nitrogen (NE2), thus it is named as Hid57 (AMBER nomenclature). At the beginning (Left), His57:ND1 donates two hydrogen bonds to Asp102:OD1 & OD2 and His57:NE2 accepts a hydrogen bond from PAR2’s Ser37:N. The side-chain oxygen of Ser37 (OG) forms a hydrogen bond with both of the nitrogens of FVIIa’s His57. These two hydrogen bonds are apparently not required for cleavage by a serine protease and thus may have been artificially created in building the starting structure. They are eventually lost during molecular dynamics. The right-hand panel of Figure 1 shows the catalytic site averaged over the last 18 ns of the 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation. In the last 43 ns, there were no positional restraints on the FVIIa catalytic site or PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37. Thus, PAR2’s Ser37 rotates away from FVIIa’s His57 and towards FVIIa’s Gly193. FVIIa’s His57:NE2, previous forming a hydrogen bond with PAR2’s Ser37:N, loses this hydrogen bond, forms a new hydrogen bonds with PAR2’s Arg36:N and with FVIIa’s Ser195:OG. This is a step back from cleavage as seen in the transition state diagram (Figure 11-27 of) where His57:NE2—Ser195:OG hydrogen bond occurs before, not after, the His57:NE2—Ser37:N hydrogen bond. It suggests that the simulations captured both hydrogen bonds at different times, but they did not appear in the right time sequence since bond formation and breaking at Arg36 and Ser37 were not part of the simulation. The four hydrogen bonds on the side-chain of Arg36 however were very stable despite movements of Asp189, Ser190, and Gly219 during the simulations. Overall, the transition state of the FVIIa catalytic site is maintained throughout the simulations thus facilitating meaningful interactions of other parts of the PAR2 extracellular polypeptide with the FVIIa protease domain. 2. Structural Changes Along Simulation Trajectories With PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 in place, the other parts of the PAR2 ectodomain fold and approach the FVIIa protease domain as demonstrated in Figure 2, from starting structure (A) to the end of the 4-ns implicit solvent molecular dynamics (B) and to the last 18-ns average of 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (C). The implicit solvent molecular dynamics is stopped before other parts of the PAR2 bind to FVIIa. This allows water molecules to be added between PAR2 and FVIIa in order to simulate their binding in a fully solvated environment. The RMSDs of the FVIIa protease domain and PAR2 ectodomain as a function of simulation time in explicit solvent are shown in Figure 3. The four vertical lines mark the four parameter-changing events in the simulation (see METHODS). The FVIIa RMSD increases to 0.8 A during equilibration but only slightly increases after that. It is not affected by either Event 1 or 2, has a slight drop and then increase again after Event 3 (the crystal Cl− ion is released from the PAR2-FVIIa interface at 19 ns), and is mostly stable after Event 4 (increase of temperature to 310 K at 33 ns). The PAR2 RMSD fluctuations are expectedly much larger. It basically fluctuates between 5 and 9 A during 0–15 ns, fluctuations are smaller after Event #2 (the atomic charges of the Gly71 carboxyl group are changed to zeros), becomes stable after Event #3, and fluctuates between 8 and 12 A after Event #4. Thus, at physiological temperature the PAR2 ectodomain is more dynamic than it is at room temperature. Visualizing the trajectory we see that the most of the flexibility in the PAR2 ectodomain occurs before Arg31 and after Glu56, accounting for the fluctuation of the PAR2 RMSD (see also Supporting Information S2). We also note the stability of folded regions of the ectodomain that are distal from the cleavage site (see Figure 8). Considering the RMSD and parameter changes along the simulation, we have used the simulation trajectory between 36 ns (3 ns after the temperature is set to 310 K) and 54 ns (last snapshot) for the analysis of the PAR2-FVIIa interactions. 3. Electrostatic Interactions The charged PAR2 residues and their nearby charged FVIIa residues are shown in Figure 4 (Bottom). Besides Arg36 that interacts with FVIIa’s Asp189, there are three charged PAR2 residues– Arg31, Asp43, and Glu56– that may form electrostatic interactions with FVIIa. The possible electrostatic interactions of these three residues are plotted in Figure 4 (Top) as a function of simulation time. The final, stable PAR2-FVIIa electrostatic interactions are Arg31—Asp170g and Glu56—Arg62. The Arg31—Asp170g interaction is the most stable throughout the simulation and may have already formed during the implicit-solvent molecular dynamics. PAR2’s Glu56 and FVIIa’s Arg62 are initially 30 A apart but they approach and form an interaction within 13 ns. Long-range electrostatic influence of FVIIa’s Arg84 may help attract PAR2’s Glu56 during this process. PAR2’s Asp43 forms a transient electrostatic interaction with either FVIIa’s Lys60a or Lys60c within the first 11 ns but it is eventually lost due to the repulsion between Asp43’s neighbor Lys41 and these two FVIIa residues. The binding of PAR2’s Glu56 on FVIIa’s Arg62 at 13 ns apparently causes bending of the PAR2 polypeptide between Ser37 and Glu56, which also prevents PAR2’s Asp43 from binding to either FVIIa’s Lys60a or Lys60c. 4. Hydrogen Bonds The hydrogen bonds between the PAR2 ectodomain and FVIIa were computed over the last 18 ns of the explicit solvent molecular dynamics, and those with more than 25% occupancy (percent of time the hydrogen bond is intact) are reported in Table 1. Three sets of the PAR2-FVIIa hydrogen bonds are actually charge interactions, including Arg31—Asp170g, Arg36—Asp189, and Glu56—Arg62. The hydrogen bonds on PAR2’s Arg36 have been reported in Figure 2. The remaining six PAR2-FVIIa hydrogen bonds are novel, including three with occupancy larger than 50%: Leu38:N—Leu41:O (60%), Asp43:OD1/OD2—Asn37:ND2 (30.3%+29.4%), Val53:O—Asn60d:ND2 (97.9%). The residues involved in the six hydrogen bonds are mapped in Figure 5. 5. Other Interactions In addition to electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, there are significant van der Waals interactions between FVIIa and the PAR2 residues between Arg31 and Asp43 as shown in Figure 5. In the region where these PAR2 residues bind, FVIIa forms a relatively hydrophobic trapezoidal binding pocket surrounded by several polar residues. The PAR2 ectodomain enters the binding pocket along the one edge gated by FVIIa’s K170d and K192, makes a turn at Lys34, goes along on a second edge flanked by FVIIa’s K60a and K192, makes another turn at Leu38, and exits at the third edge ended at FVIIa’s N37. K192, although not participating in either electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bond, significantly shapes the binding pocket with the hydrophobic extent of its side-chain. Inside the binding pocket, there are two deep mini pockets, one hosting PAR2’s Arg36 and the other hosting Ile39. The former is anticipated and involves residues H57, D189, S190, C191, K192, G193, D194, S195, V213, S214, W215, G216, G219, C220, and G226. The latter is novel and includes residues Q40, W141, G142, Q143, T151, K192, and G193. Interestingly, there are no stable PAR2-FVIIa interactions before PAR2’s Arg31 or after Glu56. These two ends contribute most to the RMSD fluctuations of PAR2 (Figure 3). Thus, Arg31 and Glu56 define the extent of the PAR2 substrate region that interacts with FVIIa. They also contribute to the charge complementarities between PAR2 and FVIIa. PAR2’s Arg31, Lys34, and Arg36 are close to the only two negatively charged FVIIa residues on the binding pocket surface: D170g and D60, while PAR2’s Asp43 and Glu56 are close to the positively charged FVIIa residues K60a, K60c, and R62. This charge complementarity, which involves long-range electrostatic interactions, presumably plays an important role in aligning the PAR2 n-terminal polypeptide correctly on the FVIIa protease domain during binding. 6. Antibody Study In order to address potential exosite interactions of PAR2 with the basic FVIIa residues Arg62, Arg84, Arg247, we evaluated the inhibitory effects on TF-FVIIa signaling of two monoclonal antibodies that were previously mapped to bind to this region of the FVIIa protease domain. The epitopes of 12C7 and 12D10 are overlapping, but located outside the catalytic cleft. The epitope of 12C7 contains FVIIa residues Arg247, Arg62, Arg84, and Gln87, while the epitope of 12D10 contains FVIIa residues Arg62, Arg84, and Asn63. Both antibodies have minimal effects on chromogenic substrate hydrolysis, but 12D10 produces more steric hindrance with macro molecular substrate factor X (FX) binding to FVIIa. Accordingly, 12D10 was a more potent inhibitor of Xa generation in comparison to 12C7 (Figure 6). Nevertheless, both antibodies completely inhibited TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 (Figure 6). These data provide evidence that the PAR2 binding to this FVIIa protease domain basic region makes significant contributions to the efficient orientation of the substrate to the enzyme. To understand the inhibition mechanism, we highlight the epitope residues in our FVIIa-PAR2 model in Figure 7. The FVIIa residue Arg62 in the epitopes of both 12C7 and 12D10 is seen to be interacting with PAR2, while the rest of the epitope residues do not (12D10 epitope residue Asn63’s side-chain is only ~4 A away from PAR2’s Val53 but does not form any significant interaction with PAR2). Arg62 has an electrostatic interaction with PAR2’s Glu56 (Figure 4) one of the key interactions that we see from the molecular dynamics simulations. The other major FVIIa-PAR2 interaction nearby is the hydrogen bond between FVIIa’s Asn60d and PAR2’s Val53 (Table 1 & Figure 5). Thus, 12C7 and 12D10 could inhibit TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 by blocking the electrostatic interaction between FVIIa’s Arg62 and PAR2’s Glu56 and probably the hydrogen bond between Asn60d and Val53 as well. However, charge reversal mutations (R62E/R84E) made to the FVIIa basic region do not inhibit PAR2 activation, as measured by the TR3 gene induction event (Figure 6). While this result does not eliminate the possibility that electrostatic interactions in this region help to guide substrate orientation under physiological conditions, it indicates that the specific interactions seen in the simulation are not essential for PAR2 cleavage to take place.

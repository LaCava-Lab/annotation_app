Figures (a) CuFL1 detection of NO in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. [CuFL1] = 1 μM, [17β-estradiol] = 100 nM. From left to right: 25 min exposure to CuFL1, no 17β-estradiol; 5 min; 10 min; 15 min; 25 min exposure to CuFL1 and 17β-estradiol. Top: Fluorescence images; Bottom: DIC images. Scale bars = 50 μm. (b) CuFL1 detection of NO in Raw 264.7 murine macrophages. [CuFL1] = 1 μM, [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] = 500 ng/mL, [interferon-γ (IFN-γ)] = 250 U/mL. From left to right: 12 h exposure to CuFL1, no LPS/IFN-γ; 6 h; 8 h; 10 h; 12 h exposure to CuFL1 and LPS/IFN-γ. Top: Fluorescence images; Bottom: DIC images. Scale bars = 50 μm. For additional details see ref.  (a) Relative energies of the molecular orbitals for the ground states of FL1 (left) and FL1-NO (right). (b) Qualitative molecular orbital diagram for the ground (left), excited (middle), and charge-transfer (right) states of FL1. R1 = 2-methylquinoline; R2 = fluorophore. For additional details see ref.. Visualization of fluorescence enhancement by CuFL1 in J774A.1 infected macrophages at 2 and 18 h post-infection. Top row: bNOS-expressing B. anthracis (Sterne) cells taken up by macrophages. Sterne cells produce NO using bNOS within 2 h of uptake. The host macrophages produce NO using iNOS between 2 and 18 h. Middle row: bNOS-deficient B. anthracis cells taken up by macrophages. No fluorescence is observed after 2 h because these bacteria cannot generate NO. The host macrophages produce NO using iNOS as usual. Bottom row: Control, no bacteria and no induction of iNOS Structure of human glutathione S-transferase P1-1 monomer containing a bound dinitrosyl iron complex. Coordinates were taken from PDB code 1ZGN; for additional details see ref.. Cyclic voltammogram of (Et4N)[Fe(NO)2(BIPM)] displaying the reversible {Fe(NO)2}9/10 couple. Conditions: 3 mM in CH3CN; glassy carbon electrode; 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 electrolyte; 100 mV/s scan rate. Comparison of selected spectroscopic and structural properties for two homologous DNIC redox partners. Thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability. Hydrogen atoms and the PPN+ cation in the {Fe(NO)2} structure are omitted for clarity. For additional details see ref.. Common {Fe(NO2)}-containing species.

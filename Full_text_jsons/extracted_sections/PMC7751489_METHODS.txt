Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection Normal gastric GES-1 cells, a mouse gastric carcinoma cell line (MFC) and various human GC cell lines including, HGC-27, AGS and MKN-45 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Each cell line was maintained in DMEM/F12 1:1 medium (HyClone; Cytiva) supplemented with 10% FBS (HyClone; Cytiva) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2, as previously described. Cells were split every 3 days and were diluted 1 day before each experiment. The expression of CBX2 in GC cell lines was analyzed using the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE; ). shRNA-CBX2, shRNA-dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) and negative control (NC) shRNA plasmids cloned into the PLL3.79 lentiviral vector were constructed by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. Lentiviruses (10 µg/ml) were transduced into MFC cells (2×104/well) for 36 h. The sequences of shRNA-CBX2 and shRNA-DKK1 used were as follows: shRNA-CBX2-1, 5′-GCTGGTCCTCCAAACATAACA-3′; shRNA-CBX2-2, 5′-GGCCTTCCAGAAGAAGGAACA-3′; shRNA-DKK1-1, 5′-GCTCTCATGGACTAGAAATAT-3′; shRNA-DKK1-2, 5′-GGAATAAGTACCAGACCATTG-3′; and shRNA-NC, 5′-TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. YAP-overexpression plasmids and control overexpression plasmids cloned into the pCDNA3.1 vector were provided by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. MFC cells (2×104/well) were transfected with 100 pmol pcDNA-3.1 vectors using Lipofectamine® 2000 (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 36 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. shRNA-CBX2-1 and shRNA-DKK1-1 was selected for further experimentation. Cells were divided into control (without treatment), shRNA-NC (infected with unrelated sequence), shRNA-CBX2 (infected with shRNA-CBX2) and shRNA-CBX2 + YAP groups (infected with shRNA-CBX2 and transfected with YAP plasmids). At 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting or reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect the efficiency of infection or transfection. RT-qPCR Total RNA (1 µg) from cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Takara Bio, Inc.) and synthesized into cDNA using a Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), according to manufacturer's protocol. RT-qPCR was performed using Roche SYBR-Green PCR kits (Roche Diagnostics) and carried out using an Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The following thermocycling conditions were used for qPCR: Predenaturation at 95°C for 10 min; followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 1 min and 60°C for 1 min; and 4°C for preservation. The relative quantitation of target gene expression was calculated using the 2−ΔΔCq method and normalized to the expression of GAPDH. The primer sequences were as follows: CBX2 forward, 5′-CTGTGTCAAGGGCAGTGCTA-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATACGTGCTCGATGAGGCTG-3′; DKK1 forward, 5′-GGAAGGAAACCCACCAACTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCAATGCAGTACAGGCGAAG-3′; YAP forward, 5′-GGATTTCTGCCTTCCCTGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GATAGCAGGGCGTGAGGAAC-3′; and GAPDH forward, 5′-CTGGGCTACACTGAGCACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-AAGTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAATG-3′. Western blotting According to the manufacturer's protocol, nuclear and cytosolic cellular proteins were obtained using the nuclear protein extraction agent and cytoplasmic protein extraction agent, respectively (both purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). A BCA assay was employed to determine the protein concentration. Subsequently, equal quantities of protein (25 µg) were separated via 10% SDS-PAGE, and subsequently transferred onto PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated at 4°C overnight with the following primary antibodies: Anti-CBX2 (1:1,000; cat. no. ab235305; Abcam), β-catenin (1:1,000; cat. no. 8480; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), c-myc (1:1,000; cat. no. ab32072; Abcam), cyclin D1 (1:1,000; cat. no. 55506; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP7 (1:1,000; cat. no. 71031; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), MMP13 (1:1,000; cat. no. 94808; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), phosphorylated (P)-YAP (1:500; cat. no. 13619; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), YAP (1:1,000; cat. no. 14710; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and GAPDH (1:1,000; cat. no. 5174; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Subsequently, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; cat. no. DC03L; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000; cat. no. DC02L; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were visualized using the Tanon-5200 Chemiluminescence Imager (Tanon Science and Technology Co., Ltd.) with an ECL western blotting substrate (EMD Millipore). Band intensity was semi-quantified using ImageJ (v1.8.0; National Institutes of Health) and relative protein levels were normalized to GAPDH (1:1,000; cat. no. 3683; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), β-actin (1:1,000; cat. no. 5125; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or LAMINB (1:1,000; cat. no. 24209; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay A CCK-8 assay was performed to determine cell viability. MFC cells (2×103 cells/well) were seeded into a 96-well plate and incubated at 37°C. At 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, the absorbance of cells was measured at 450 nm after addition of 10 µl CCK-8 reagent (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. Experiments were performed six times for each sample. Colony formation assay MFC cells transfected with or without shRNA CBX2 and DKK1 were seeded into a 35-mm petri dish (1×103/well). After culture for 10–14 days, the resulting cell colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 20 min at room temperature. Colonies with diameters >0.5 mm were imaged and counted using a digital camera (Nikon Corporation). Wound healing assay MFC cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 5×105 cells/well. The monolayer was scratched with a 100-µl pipette tip once cells had reached 90% confluence. Floating cells were subsequently removed by washing with PBS and plates were maintained in serum-free medium at 37°C. Finally, transfected MFC cells were imaged using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation) at 0 and 48 h after wounding. The width of the wound was measured to estimate the migration of MFC cells. The recovered wound area (%) at the indicated time point (48 h) was calculated according to the following formula: [(wound width at 0 h) - (wound width at 48 h)]/wound width at 0 h. Transwell assay Transfected MFC cells were suspended in serum-free medium (5×105 cells/ml) and added to the upper chamber of the Transwell instrument, which was pre-coated with Matrigel at 37°C for 4 h. The lower chamber was filled with culture medium containing 20% FBS. After incubation for 24 h at 37°C, cells on the bottom of the membrane were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min at 37°C, stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. The number of cells from five different fields were captured and counted using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation). Statistical analysis Data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp.) and GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Differences among multiple groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

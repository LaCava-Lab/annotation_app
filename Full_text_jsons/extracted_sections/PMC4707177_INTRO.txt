Specifications table the very first NMR experimental data set to compute the three-dimensional structure of CupS in solution; this data set might help to elucidate the function of CupS not fully understood to date; this data set might serve as a reference for future studies of CupS molecular complexes. Value of the data Data We have extracted a total of 2089 NOE distance restraints from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOESY spectra, which were processed using NMRPipe. Spectra exhibit substantial chemical shift dispersion â€“ a feature also observed for the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of CupS (Fig. 1). In total, this data set consists of 929 intra-residual, 448 sequential, 281 medium range, and 431 long-range NOE distance restraints, supplemented by 221 NMR-derived dihedral angle restraints from TALOS+. These experimental restraints are compatible with the software suite ARIA 2.3 /CNS 1.2.1. NOEs were picked manually and obvious intraresidual and sequential NOEs were assigned hand-operated. ARIA2.3 /CNS 1.2.1 and UNIO (ATNOS/CANDID) /CYANA 3.0 software packages were used to automatically assign the picked NOE resonances.

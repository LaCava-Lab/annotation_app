RESULTS Effect of Ethanol on NMDA Receptor Single-Channel Conductance. In outside-out patches from cells expressing GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptor subunits, low concentrations of glutamate (0.1 – 1 μM) in the presence of a saturating concentration of glycine (50 μM) elicited a low level of NMDA receptor activity, with groups of openings widely separated by long closings (Fig. 1.). This pattern of activity was observed in both the absence and the presence of ethanol (156 mM, GluN2A; 150 mM, GluN2B). Ethanol did not alter the single-channel chord conductance determined from all-points histograms (Fig. 2; GluN2A: 54.6 ± 1.63 vs. 56.7 ± 2.59 pS in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 54.2 ± 1.23 vs. 52.5 ± 1.75 pS in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches), and did not produce any evident alteration in the appearance of the single-channel records, such as flickering block (Fig 3A,C; Fig 4 A, C). Effects of Ethanol on Open Times. Open time distributions for glutamate-activated current in GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors could be adequately fitted by two components (GluN2A: 62.6 ± 6.24 μs and 4.01 ± 0.441 ms; GluN2B: 130 ± 16.9 μs and 5.39 ± 0.234 ms) with similar proportions of openings (GluN2A: 48.3 ± 2.38 % and 51.8 ± 2.39 %, and GluN2B: 49.7 ± 3.81 % and 50.3 ± 3.81 % for the fast and slow components, respectively, Fig. 3B, 4B). The mean open times were 3.21 ± 0.341 ms (GluN2A) and 3.51 ± 0.216 ms (GluN2B). In the presence of ethanol mean open time was decreased in GluN2A by 33% to 2.17 ± 0.243 ms (Fig 3D; P < 0.001, paired t-test, N = 7 patches), and in GluN2B by 42% to 2.05 ± 0.376 ms (Fig 4D; P < 0.01, paired t-test, N = 7 patches). Open time distributions in the presence of ethanol were also well fitted by two components; the time constant of the fast component was not significantly changed compared to the control condition (GluN2A: 50.3 ± 3.97 μs; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 138 ± 42.1 μs; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches), but that of the slow component was significantly decreased (GluN2A: 3.07 ± 0.345 ms; paired t-test, P < 0.001, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 3.59 ± 0.269 ms; paired t-test, P < 0.01, N = 7 patches). In the GluN2A subunit, but not the GluN2B subunit, the areas of both components were significantly changed, such that there were relatively more fast openings in the presence of ethanol (62.0 ± 4.11 % and 38.0 ± 4.12 % for the fast and slow components, respectively; paired t-test, P < 0.05, N = 7 patches). In contrast, overall frequency of opening was not changed by ethanol in either subunit type (GluN2A: 7.91 ± 1.96 vs. 7.34 ± 1.30 for control and ethanol-treated patches, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 15.8 ± 6.52 vs. 13.6 ± 5.99 for control and ethanol-treated patches, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches). Effects of Ethanol on Shut Times. For both subunit types, shut time distributions for patches in the absence of ethanol could be fitted with five exponential components ranging from approximately 50 μs to 400 ms (Table 1 and Fig 4). Similar distributions were also obtained in the same patches exposed to ethanol. In contrast to its effects on open time, ethanol did not alter any of the shut time constants (repeated measures ANOVA, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches) or their relative areas (repeated measures ANOVA, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches). As would be expected from the observation above that ethanol did not produce flickering block, ethanol did not introduce any additional shut times. Fitting of Burst Data to a Kinetic Model. A distinct separation was evident in the shut time distributions between the third and fourth components in GluN2A subunit-containing receptors and between the fourth and fifth components in GluN2B subunit-containing receptors. In the GluN2A subunit, the shortest three shut times are considered to occur within an individual activation of the receptor-ion channel. Of the longest two shut times, one represents a long-lived desensitized state (within an activation), and one the agonist-unbound state (between activations). Although there is evidence from some studies that ethanol may influence NMDAR desensitization, the absence of a change in the closed time corresponding to the desensitized state in the presence of ethanol is consistent with a negligible effect under the conditions used in this study. In the GluN2B subunit, the longest two shut times are considered to differentiate individual activations of the receptor-ion channel. To determine the effects of ethanol on gating transitions in the fully-liganded, non-desensitized receptor, we grouped opening events into bursts that should correspond to individual activations of the receptor by choosing values of τcrit between the third and fourth (GluN2A) or fourth and fifth (GluN2B) shut time components (Fig 5, arrows). Values of τcrit determined for patches in the absence and presence of ethanol were 10.7 and 8.9 ms, respectively for GluN2A and 83.3 and 151 ms, respectively for GluN2B. We extracted bursts from the idealized data record such that closed times longer than the τcrit value were not included in the analysis. Maximal interval likelihood fitting of bursts to scheme 1 of, a cyclic model that does not incorporate agonist binding and unbinding steps or desensitized states (Fig. 6), yielded values for the rate constants that in general were similar to those previously determined (Table 2). In both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, ethanol selectively altered two of the kinetic transitions: it decreased the rate constant for the slow forward rate, ks+, by 28.4 % (paired t-test, P < 0.0005) in GluN2A and by 30.2 % (paired t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2B, and increased the reverse rate between open states, o−, by 49.8 % (t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2A and 31 % (t-test, P < 0.05) in GluN2B. The remaining kinetic values were not appreciably altered by ethanol (mean change: 8.0 percent; t-tests, P > 0.05). To test whether the two changed rate constants could account for the observed decreases in mean open time and open probability due to ethanol, we substituted these rates in the model and generated simulated current traces using the QUB program, leaving all other rates unchanged from their control values. Changing the slow forward rate, ks+, and the open state reverse rate, o−, to their values in the presence of ethanol accounted for 91% and 90% of the inhibitory effect of ethanol on open probability in the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, respectively.

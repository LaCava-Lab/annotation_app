Materials and Methods Protein Construct Information All protein expression constructs used in this study have been previously described and are available through Addgene. These include full-length HTT with C-terminal FLAG-tag (Q23, Q25, Q30, Q36, Q42, Q52. Q54, Q60 and Q66), full-length HTT with N-terminal FLAG-tag (Q23, Q66), full-length HAP40, and full-length ataxin-3 (Q10, Q80). For full construct details and Addgene accession numbers, see Supplementary Table 1. Protein Expression and Purification Full-length HTT proteins and HTT-HAP40 protein complexes were produced as previously described and all plasmids are available through Addgene (“available plasmids from Journal of Biological Chemistry,” 2024). Briefly, Sf9 cells were infected with P3 recombinant baculovirus and grown until viability dropped to 80–85%, normally ~72 h post-infection. For HTT-HAP40 complex production, a 1:1 ratio of HTT:HAP40 P3 recombinant baculovirus was used for infection. Cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol supplemented with protease inhibitors and benzonase, then lysed with multiple freeze–thaw cycles and clarified by centrifugation. Proteins were purified by FLAG-affinity chromatography. All samples were purified with a final gel filtration step, using a Superose6 10/300 column in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 2.5% (v/v) glycerol. Fractions of the peaks corresponding to the HTT monomer or HTT-HAP40 heterodimer were pooled, concentrated to 1 mg/mL, aliquoted and flash frozen prior to use in downstream experiments. Sample purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. N586 HTT Q68 and fusion HTT Q68 recombinant proteins were generated as previously described. Briefly, the N586 fragment of the HTT gene was amplified by PCR of full-length HTT with BamHI and NotI restriction sites in the 5’ and 3’ primers, respectively. The PCR product was purified using the QiaQuick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and digested with BamHI and Not1 to create sticky ends. the pGEX-6p-1 expression vector was digested using BamHI and NotI and gel purified. The insert and vector were ligated and transformed into DH5 E. coli and plated overnight on LB-agar plates containing 100 μ g/mL ampicillin. Colonies were screened by Qiagen mini-prep and confirmed by sequencing. The newly generated plasmids were then transformed into BL21 DE3 E. coli that were grown to OD 600 values of 0.8 and induced for protein production by IPTG. Cultures were lysed, and recombinant protein isolated by GST column purification and buffer exchanged into PBS using Amicon Ultra 10K MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore). Recombinant proteins were quantified using a BCA assay (Pierce) and checked for purity using silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels. Ataxin-3 proteins were produced as previously described. Ataxin-3 Q10 was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) (Agilent). Ataxin-3 Q80 was produced by baculoviral transduction of this construct in Sf9 insect cell culture. For both proteins, harvested cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP supplemented with protease inhibitors and benzonase. The cell suspension was lysed by sonication and the clarified lysate was incubated with Talon resin (Cytiva). Resin was washed with a purification buffer supplemented with 5 mM imidazole and proteins eluted with a purification buffer supplemented with 300 mM imidazole. Eluted proteins were further purified by gel filtration using a S200 16/60 column equilibrated in the purification buffer. All samples were aliquoted, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to use. Protein purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Mapping of HDB4 epitopes Expression vectors to produce exon 1, N171, and N586 HTT proteins were generated by amplifying the indicated regions from full-length human HTT template DNA (Q68) by PCR, using primers with EcoRI and NotI restriction sites in the 5’ and 3’ primers respectively (Supplementary Table 1). The PCR products were purified by gel extraction using the QiaQuick gel extraction kit. The PCR products and pCI-Neo mammalian expression vector were then digested using EcoRI and NotI, gel purified, ligated, and transformed into Max Efficiency DH5α E. coli cells (Invitrogen #18258-012), then plated overnight on LB-agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Colonies picked from these plates were grown overnight in LB with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, then plasmid DNA was purified (Qiagen miniprep kit), and screened by restriction digest with EcoRI and NotI. Clones with expected sizes on restriction digest were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, then cultures were grown for large-scale DNA purification (Promega Maxiprep Kit). HEK293 cells were plated at 3x105 cells per well in a 6-well plate and grown overnight to 80% confluence, then transfected (Lipofectamine 2000). Alongside the Exon1, N171, and N586 constructs, pmaxGFP vector (Lonza) was included as a positive control for transfection, and strong GFP expression was observed 20 hours post-transfection. Cell pellets were harvested and lysed in SDP plus protease inhibitors. Proteins were quantified by DC assay, and SDS-PAGE was used for confirmation of protein purity and subsequent Western blotting with BKP1 and HDB4E10 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation-Flow Cytometry (IP-FCM) The IP-FCM technique has been previously described. Briefly, capture antibodies were coupled to 5 μm CML latex microbeads (Invitrogen) and counted on a hemocytometer before storage at 4°C. Probe antibodies were biotinylated using EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Thermo Scientific), free biotin removed by buffer exchange in Amicon Ultra 3K MWCO spin columns (Millipore), and antibody concentration brought to 0.5 mg/ml before storage at 4°C in PBS. Protein samples were diluted 1000 fM unless otherwise stated. CSF samples were diluted 1:1 to a total volume of 100 μl per replicate. Approximately 104 beads in 5 μl NP-40 buffer (150mM NaCl, 50mM Tris (ph7.4), Halt Phosphatase and Protease inhibitors (10ul/ml), 0.5 M EDTA, 2mM Sodium Orthovanadate, 10mM NaF, 10mM Iodoacetamide, Surfact-Amps NP-40 1% (v/v) (Thermo Scietific, CAT#28324)) were mixed with 25 μl of recombinant protein in aCSF (125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCL, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM MgCL2, 26 mM NaCO3, 2 mM CaCl2, 25 mM Dextrose) and incubated overnight at 4°C with rotation to prevent beads settling out of suspension. Beads were then washed in IP-FCM buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 % (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 0.01 % (w/v) sodium azide) and incubated with biotinylated probe antibodies for 2 h, followed by another wash in IP-FCM buffer, incubation with 1:200 Streptavidin-PE (BD Biosciences) for 1 h, a final wash, and measurement on an Accuri flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Bead doublets were gated out based on forward scatter area vs. forward scatter height plots, and a singlet bead gate was defined based on forward scatter height vs. side scatter height. All samples were run in three replicates, and the average of the median fluorescence intensity in the FL2 channel in the singlet bead gate indicated the abundance of HTT in the sample. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Analysis of HTT Allelic Series and Ataxin-3 proteins ELISAs were conducted as previously described with some adaptations. Full-length HTT samples corresponding to an allelic series (Q-lengths 23, 25, 30, 36, 42, 52, 54, 60, 66) or Ataxin-3 samples (Q-lengths 10, 80) were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as per manufacturer’s protocol. All proteins were diluted to 1 μg/mL using gel filtration buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP at pH 7.4) and incubated in 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates (Thermofisher Scientific, cat#442404) for 16 h at 4°C. Plates were washed four times with PBS with 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T 0.005%) and blocked with PBS-T 0.005% with 1% (w/v) BSA (blocking buffer) for 2 h at 37°C and then for 3 h at 4°C. Plates were washed four times then incubated for 16 h at 4°C with 12-point 1:3 serial dilution of anti-polyQ MW1 (DSHB) in with each concentration in triplicate. The plate was then washed four times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) secondary antibody (1/50 000, Invitrogen, cat# 31430). After washing six times with blocking buffer, 100 μL of 1X TMB substrate (Invitrogen) was added per well and incubated at RT for ~15 mins. The reaction was then quenched with 100 μL of 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbances were measured at 450 nm using the BioTek Gen5 microplate reader (ThermoFisher Scientific). The following four negative control conditions were tested in triplicate wells to determine the total background signal: no HTT protein, no primary antibody, no secondary antibody, and washing buffer only. After defining specific binding as the absorbance values after subtracting the average absorbance of these control wells, the data was fitted to specific binding with hill slope using GraphPad Prism version 9.5.1. Western Blot Analysis of HTT Allelic Series Full-length HTT samples corresponding to an allelic series (Q-lengths 23, 25, 30, 36, 42, 52, 54, 60, 66) were quantified using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as per manufacturer’s protocol. 5 or 50 ng of each sample was loaded per lane on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) in 1X NuPAGE MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 120 V. The proteins were then transferred onto 0.22 μM PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) for 6 h at 30 V and 4°C. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) milk powder in PBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBS-T 0.1%) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), washed 3 times with PBS-T 0.1%, and then incubated with anti-polyQ MW1 (1/2000; DSHB) and anti-HTT EPR5526 (1/10,000; Abcam) for 16 h at 4°C with rocking. After three washing steps, the membrane was probed with secondary antibodies goat-anti-rabbit IgG-IR800 (1/3000, LI-COR) and donkey anti-mouse IgG-IR680 (1/3000, LI-COR) for 1 h at RT with rocking. The Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR) was used to image the membrane and ImageStudio (LI-COR) was used for signal quantitation. MW1 depletion of Hu97/18 brain lysates and downstream analysis by western blot and MW1/HDB4 IP-FCM Hu97/18 mice were killed with an overdose of intraperitoneal avertin and brains removed and placed on ice for ~1 min to increase tissue rigidity. Olfactory bobs and cerebella were removed and the forebrain isolated, divided into hemispheres, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at −80°C until use. Forebrain hemisphere were lysed by mechanical homogenization in NP-40 buffer, incubation on ice for 15 min., sonication at 25% for 5s, and removal of debris by centrifugation at 14,000xG for 10 min at 4°C. MW1 conjugated to magnetic dynabeads was incubated with 40 μg of total protein overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation. Beads were then isolated with a magnet and the flow through collected. The immunoprecipitation (beads) was separated on a low bis-acrylamide gel as previously described along with the flow through, and 40 μg of total lysate protein (input). Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked for 1 hr at RT in 10% powdered milk in PBS, and probed HTT (MAB2166, Millipore) and calnexin (Sigma C4731) as a loading control. Primary antibodies were detected with IR dye 800CW goat anti-mouse (Rockland 610-131-007) and AlexaFluor 680 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes A21076)-labelled secondary antibodies, and the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imaging system. Band intensity was measured using densitometry and normalization to calnexin loading control.

Materials and Methods Plant growth and inoculation Seeds of the soybean cultivar Hua Chun 6 were sown in floriculture substrate in pots [15 cm (D) × 15 cm (H)] and grown in a greenhouse (70% relative humidity, 25°C/20°C day/night temperature, 14 h/10 h photoperiod) at a density of two plants per pot. These pots contained a mixture of sand and floriculture substrate at a ratio of 1:1. Samples of B. maydis race O (Y664) were collected from Wenshan Prefecture (east longitude 104°35′ and northern latitude 23°18′) in China’s Yunnan Province and preserved at the Yunnan Agricultural University College of Plant Protection. The B. maydis isolate was grown for 8 days at 27°C in a culture medium containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) and in the dark. The PDA medium was prepared as described elsewhere. Conidia were collected with sterilized water (with 0.1% Tween-20) and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 105 conidia per mL. This mixture served as the inoculating solution. Then, 200 mL of sterilized water (with 0.1% Tween-20) was used for mock inoculation of the controls, and 200 mL of the conidia solution was used to inoculate the treatment groups. At 72 h post-inoculation, soybean leaves, stems, and roots were collected from both B. maydis-inoculated and mock-inoculated (control) soybean seedlings, and the stems and roots were cut into 1-cm sections for easier grounding. Three replicates were prepared for each experiment. Protein extraction from soybean leaves One gram of leaf tissue (1.5 g of stem and root tissue) was ground to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle and in liquid nitrogen. The powder was transferred to a 50-mL centrifuge tube and supplemented with 20 mL of a pre-cooled mixture of 10% trichloroacetic acid and 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 50 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTT), vortex mixed with acetone, and incubated overnight (or for 16 h–18 h) at -20°C. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and the protein pellet was washed three times with 2 mM PMSF and 50 mM DTT in 80% acetone. The pellet was dried with a circulating water vacuum pump (SHZ-IIID, Shanghai, China). A 20-mg fraction of the protein powder was then resuspended in 450 μL of lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 5% (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 2 mM DTT, and 0.3% Biolyte) by flicking the tube wall with fingers, and then incubated for 1 h at 25°C (or room temperature). The suspension was later centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 20 min at 25°C, and then the resulting supernatant was collected. The protein content of the samples was quantitated using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as protein standard. For each treatment, three independent proteins were prepared, and triplicate 2-DE gels were used for each sample. 2-DE used for protein separation Six samples were individually run in triplicate to control gel variation. Approximately 600 μg of the purified protein extract was adjusted to a total volume of 500 μL with a rehydration buffer containing 7 M urea, 5% (w/v) CHAPS, 0.5% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient (IPG) buffer (pH 4–7 NL) (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany), and freshly prepared 20 mM DTT for every 24-cm IPG strip (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The adjusted protein solution was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 22,000 rpm at 4°C and then was directly loaded into a focusing tray. IPG strips (4–7 NL, 24 cm; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) were passively rehydrated for 14 h at 20°C. Then, the proteins (three replicates per treatment) were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and then in the second dimension via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). IEF was conducted using the IPGphor system (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) under the following conditions: 250 V for 30 min with a linear ramp, 1,000 V for a minimum of 1 h with a rapid ramp, 9,000 V for 4.5 h with a linear ramp, and finally, 9,000 V at 65,000 V/h with a rapid ramp; the entire system was kept at 20°C. After IEF, the strips were equilibrated with 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 30% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 130 mM DTT for 20 min. The second equilibration step was performed in a solution consisting of 6 M urea, 2% SDS, 1.5 M Tris–HCl (pH 8.8), 30% glycerol, 0.02% bromophenol blue, and 135 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) for 20 min. The equilibrated strips were placed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and sealed with 1% low-melting agarose. SDS-PAGE was performed at 20 mA/gel first and then adjusted to a constant current of 30 mA/gel after 45 min. The 2-DE gels were fixed with the mixture solution (40% ethanol, 10% acetic acid) for 3 h at 16°C, and then stained overnight with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250. The protein spots were detected by destaining with a mixture solution (5% w/v ammonium sulfate and 0.5% methanol). SDS-PAGE analysis Gels were then carefully washed with double-distilled water, scanned at an optical resolution of 300 dpi (or 600 dpi), and saved as.tiff files. For spot detection and volume quantification, 300 dpi.tiff files were analyzed using the PDQuest software version 7.4. To correct for variability in CBB staining, the individual spot volumes were normalized by dividing each spot’s optical density (OD) value by the sum total OD of all the spots in the respective gels. Automated and manual spot matching were also performed. The relative volumes were used to identify individual spots that were significantly differentially expressed between the two groups of gels (at least two-fold higher or lower and statistically significant as calculated by the student’s t-test, at P < 0.05) (|ratio|≥2, P < 0.05). Only those with significant and reproducible changes were considered differentially expressed proteins. Protein spot in-gel digestion, identification, and prediction of protein function Soybean leaf, stem, and root proteins with differential expression patterns (|ratio|≥2, P < 0.05) on gels were manually excised, washed three times with Millipore® pure water, and subjected to in-gel digestion and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis, as described elsewhere. The resulting peptide sequence data were submitted to the online MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, U.K.) (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean) and queried against NCBInr databases. The minimum requirements of our protein analysis were as follows: (i) at least three peptide sequences with identities higher than the threshold matched; and (ii)≧9% coverage of the total protein sequence by matching peptide-positive matches were BLASTP searched against the NCBI protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for updated annotation and identification of homologous proteins. Some of the predicted cellular locations were determined using the Plant-PLoc version 2.0 (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/). STRING (http://www.string-db.org/) was used for predicting protein-protein interactions

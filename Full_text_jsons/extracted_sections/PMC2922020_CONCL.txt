Conclusions and Outlook Detailed knowledge of the chemical reactivity of nitric oxide in the biological milieu is required for a complete understanding of its physiology and pathology. We have explored this reactivity by identifying where NO is produced and how it is utilized in cells using fluorescent probes and, in biomimetic chemistry, by investigating the fundamental inorganic chemistry of NO with iron-sulfur protein active site models. This dual approach is well suited to the study of small molecules of biological interest like nitric oxide, and we envision that it may also be successful in studies of other such species including peroxynitrite, nitroxyl, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide.

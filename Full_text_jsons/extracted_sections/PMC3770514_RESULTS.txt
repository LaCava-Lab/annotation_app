Results The main goal of this investigation was to develop and test a new method of insulin production enhancement in 1.4E7 beta-cells (Figure 1A). Preliminary data from the literature support the involvement of MIF in enhancement of insulin secretion. This implication is supported by the fact that MIF is a secretory product of the insulin-producing cell that functions as an autocrine regulator of insulin release. Characterization of MWCNTs The diameter and length of the MWCNTs used in the experiments were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 1B). Oxidation of nanotubes was performed using 3:1 (v/v) sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid, which gave them hydrophilicity and stability in aqueous systems due to the formation of COOH and OH groups at the end of or on the lateral sides of the tubes. Next, we covalently conjugated NA onto the surfaces of oxidized MWCNTs. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is a simple but effective method confirming the formation of oxidized NA-MWCNT complexes. Nanotube solutions give an 295.7 nm absorption band, corresponding to transition plasmon MWCNTs (red spectrum). NA solution is characteristic of the 260 nm absorption band, suggesting infrared aromatic structures. Comparing the above-mentioned range, the formation of NA-MWCNT complexes becomes obvious due to the band specific for MWCNTs and the 260 nm band which has a low intensity (blue spectrum) (Figure 1C). Immunofluorescence microscopy As seen in Figure 2 (row 4) red fluorescence (Texas Red anti-insulin antibody) in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs (5 mg/L for 30 minutes) showed bright, elongated, and punctate fluorescence, evenly spread in the cell cytoplasm, strongly suggesting increased insulin production compared with exposure to 5 mg/L MWCNTs/NA/PBS for 30 minutes. These cells showed a decreased fluorescent signal with less insulin vesicles being visualized. In almost all NA-MWCNT-treated cells, we noticed specific movement of insulin vesicles to the cellular membrane, which resulted in strong diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence. ImageJ quantification of all fluorescent images following treatment of 1.4E7 cells with NA-MWCNTs revealed significantly increased red fluorescence, suggesting insulin production (Chi square test, P < 0.05). Thus, the average area of red fluorescence/total number of cells between cells treated was 3.4 versus 7.2 for 1 mg/L, 5.9 versus 13.1 for 5 mg/L, and 6.9 versus 17.4 for 20 mg/L. Flow cytometric quantification of insulin-producing cells Flow cytometry showed that cultures treated with NA-MWCNTs (5 mg/L) had an increase of 87.3% in insulinpositive cells following incubation (Figure 3Aii), whereas treatment with 5 mg/L NA in similar conditions (Figure 3Ai) resulted in an increase of only 56.3% in insulin-positive cells. Thus, quantification of flow cytometric data from all cells (red FL3 channel) revealed a significantly decreased fluorescence signal (Chi square test, P < 0.05), suggesting a lower proliferation rate in 1.4E7 cells treated with NA only compared with those treated with NA-MWCNTs. ELISA quantification of insulin secretion from beta-cell population Using ELISA to quantify the amount of insulin released in cell culture medium under glucose stimulation following treatment with NA-MWCNTs/NA/MWCNTs/PBS administered at various concentrations and various incubation times, it was found that 1.4E7 cultures treated with NA-MWCNTs secreted more insulin into the supernatant as compared with cultures exposed to NA. As seen in Figure 3B, 1.4E7 cells treated for 30 minutes with NA-MWCNTs at concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 20 mg/L showed significantly increased insulin release (0.18 ± 0.026 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.21 ± 0.024 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.27 ± 0.028 ng/mL for 20 mg/L). Thus, compared with cells treated with NA alone (0.1 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.12 ± 0.017 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.17 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 20 mg/L, Figure 3C) we observed a significant positive effect on insulin release in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs (Mann–Whitney U test, P = 0.046 for 1 mg/L, P = 0.037 for 5 mg/L, and P = 0.028 for 20 mg/L). Immunocytochemical localization of MIF in 1.4E7 beta-cells To shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the enhancement of insulin production mediated by MWCNTs, 1.4E7 cells were immunostained with anti-MIF and anti-insulin antibodies (Figure 4). To accomplish this, we allowed cells treated with 5 mg/L NA-MWCNTs for one hour to incorporate Alexa Fluor 488 anti-MIF antibody for 60 minutes at 37°C. This technique allowed us to identify MIF clearly within the cytoplasm of 1.4E7 cells (green fluorescence, Figure 4, third column) that were also positive for insulin (Figure 4, second column). Alternatively, as seen in Figure 4, we showed that anti-insulin antibodies labeled with Texas Red were predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of these cells overlapping MIF. Of utmost importance, we could clearly observe that MIF was overexpressed in NA-MWCNT-treated cells, strongly suggesting a correlation between NA-MWCNT administration and MIF expression. ImageJ analysis of all fluorescent images revealed significantly increased expression of MIF in 1.4E7 cells (Chi square test, P < 0.05) following treatment with NA-MWCNTs.

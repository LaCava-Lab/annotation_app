Conclusions The results described above demonstrated the utility of the test strip system developed in this study to analyze the receptor specificity of influenza viruses. Compared with conventional methods to analyze receptor binding affinity of influenza virus, the test strip system was simple and easy to use: only a drop of virus and the test strips were required, without any additional methods or equipment. The test strips were shown to be applicable to a broad range of group 1 influenza A vruses and allowed semi-quantitative detection of their receptor binding affinities. These results indicate that the test strips could be applied as a screening device to monitor possible evolutionary changes in AI receptor binding specificity in the field. The sensitivity of the test strips was not adequate for rapid diagnosis of clinical samples (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs). However, traditional methods for determining viral genome sequences, pathogenicity and drug resistance using isolated viruses are still routinely used in public health and academic laboratories worldwide. Since isolated virus samples contain significantly more virus than clinical samples, application of the strip test to influenza virus analysis should enable us to more easily and comprehensively monitor AI evolution and pandemic potential in the field. The strip test system described here could then be applied for rapid diagnosis in the field when its sensitivity is improved.

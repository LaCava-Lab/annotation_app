Methods Study Design and Participants This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics committee of Bharati Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University) Medical College and Hospital, Pune (IEC/2020/25). The study was conducted using 125 serum or plasma samples collected during May-September 2020 from 109 SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive COVID-19 patients. The study included: (1) Nineteen healthy volunteers negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (2) Sixty-three hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease sampled within 4 weeks of illness. These were further classified as mild (n=32) or severe (n=31) infections based on disease severity (WHO 2020) (3) 23 asymptomatic individuals identified among contacts of COVID-19 patients and (4) 23 COVID-19 patients during convalescence (1-4 months post disease onset). After informed consent, approximately 5 ml blood was collected at the time of admission from all the hospitalized patients. Follow-up blood samples were collected within 2 weeks after admission from 9 mild patients. Sequential blood samples were also collected within one week from 7 patients with severe disease. Serum or plasma samples were stored in aliquots at -80°C for further use. DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 ELISA Levels of alpha defensins, DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 in serum and plasma were quantified using commercially available ELISA kits, Neutrophil DEFA1 (USCN, Wuhan) & quantikine ELISA for human S100A8/A9 Heterodimer (R & D systems, Minneapolis) as per manufacturer’s protocols. The minimum detection limits for DEFA1 & S100A8/A9 were 20ng/ml & 40ng/ml respectively. Myeloperoxidase Assay Serum/plasma samples were diluted with 1X PBS in the ratio of 1:5. The diluted samples were then incubated with 0.75mM hydrogen peroxide solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and 1.6mM tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution (Sigma) for 10 mins. Myeloperoxidase levels were measured on the basis of OD values (450nm) obtained after the addition of TMB solution and subsequent stoppage of the reaction with sulphuric acid and absorbance was measured at 450nm. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Graph Pad Prism 5.0 software. Mann‐Whitney U test was used to compare the data between the study groups. Paired samples were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the predicted value of alpha-defensin as biomarker. The area under the curve (AUC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

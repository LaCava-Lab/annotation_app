RESULTS Computer-assisted discovery of oleacein mimetics When a 2D similarity, ligand-based VP program was executed over the Chembl(v19) database using the Tanimoto coefficient and 2D (Morgan/circular) fingerprints, only the closely related secoiridoid molecule oleocanthal (CHEMBL2172394) was identified. The execution of a comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA)-based 3D VP program, however, identified several compounds with physico-chemical similarity scores greater than 0.75 (Figure 1). Taking advantage of the previously described binding modes of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT, we ran rigid-docking calculations to characterize the binding modes of the top 20 oleacein mimetics (Supplementary Figure 1), both at the crystallographic sites and at additional cavities occurring within the whole protein structures of mTOR and DNMT (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Table 1 summarizes the computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics ranked according to reweighted energies based on short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) calculations, for both the crystallographic and the best mTOR/DNMT cavities for each of the selected oleacein mimetics (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Binding modes of oleacein mimetics to mTOR and DNMT The binding mode of oleacein to mTOR was predicted to share key amino acid residues with the binding modes of second-generation ATP-competitive TORKinhibs and, consequently, partially mimicked the binding behavior of PP242 and Torin 2 to the ATP-binding catalytic pocket. But, the presence of more aromatic rings in the oleacein molecule resulted in a slightly different binding strength from that of PP242 and Torin 2. Similarly, the presence of aromatic rings notably influenced the binding of the selected oleacein mimetics to mTOR (Figure 2). In fact, we predicted three different binding modes, one of them involving 5 oleacein mimetics that apparently shared the originally described binding mode of parental oleacein; and another two models encompassing 13 compounds and 2 compounds showing a binding mode closely resembling that of TORKinhibs (Figure 2). Rigid docking calculations originally predicted that π-π stacking would occur between the aromatic ring of oleacein and the Trp2239 residue (or Tyr2225 upon conformational changes of either oleacein or the mTOR catalytic pocket itself) in the catalytic site of mTOR. MD simulations confirmed the main occurrence of π-π stacking with Trp2239 (and a more fluctuating interaction with Tyr2225), as well as a significant number of additional residues providing key electrostatic interactions. In the case of oleacein mimetics, it was evident that Trp2239, Tyr2225, and Phe2358 played a central role in the stabilization of their respective complexes with mTOR (Supplementary Table 6). The binding mode of oleacein to DNMT was predicted to closely resemble that of DNMT inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine, SGI-110, and curcumin. In the case of oleacein mimetics, we were able to predict two different binding modes (Figure 3): one of them shared the oleacein pattern of spatial orientation and included 17 compounds and another one involved only 3 molecules (Figure 3). Rigid docking calculations and MD simulations predicted that the main residues involved in the stabilization of the oleacein-DNMT complex were Ser1446, Pro1125, Asp1143, Phe1145, Gly1150, Leu1151, Asn1158, Val1580, and Gly1223, along with a significant number of additional residues providing key electrostatic interactions. In the case of oleacein mimetics, Phe1145, Trp1170, Pro1224, and Pro1225 were predicted as the main catalytic residues (Supplementary Table 7). Oleacein mimetics specifically suppress CSC-driven mammosphere formation To explicitly test the oleacein mimetics on CSC, we measured their effect on in vitro tumorsphere formation in low-density non-adherent serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors, considered one of the gold standards for evaluating CSC self-renewal activity. As a source of CSC, we used the CSC-enriched triple-negative breast cancer model MDA-MB-436, which can form smooth and round tumorspheres (mammospheres) in suspension culture. The Cell2Sphere™ assay was used to evaluate the differential ability of oleacein mimetics to specifically suppress the ability of CSC to survive and proliferate as floating 3D microtumors without promoting nonspecific, cytotoxic effects on the same cells grown in 2D adherent, differentiating conditions (Figure 4). Using the focal adhesion kinase inhibitor VS-6063 (defactinib) and the lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A inhibitor ORY-1001 (iadademstat) as mechanistically distinct anti-CSC compounds and selecting a 10 μmol/L cut-off for 2D cytotoxicity (i.e., lower than the original IC50 value of oleacein [18 ± 5 μmol/L] against CSC-driven mammosphere formation), 4 out of the 14 oleacein mimetics tested specifically suppressed mammosphere formation, namely CHEMBL1621113 (N’-[4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane-1,3-diamine), CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), CHEMBL126593 (N-(4-nitrobenzyl)ethenesulfonamide), and CHEMBL1950046 (3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate), while not exerting significant cytotoxic effects against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D in the same low micromolar range (Figure 5). CHEMBL1085246 (N-(4-chloro-5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)hexanamide) exhibited anti-CSC activity due to unspecific cytotoxicity against CSC and non-CSC cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Oleacein mimetics target ALDH+ breast cancer stem cells Oleacein selectively suppresses functional traits of CSC such as the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a well-recognized marker of tumorigenic cell fractions enriched for proliferating, epithelial-like CSC capable of self-renewal. We next selected the 2 oleacein mimetics with the best CSC-targeted profile (i.e., anti-CSC activity at low micromolar range and lack of cytotoxic activity against differentiated cancer cells), namely CHEMBL1950046 (3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate; a.k.a. hydroxytyrosol butyrate) and CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), to evaluate their capacity to target epithelial-like CSC cells with high levels of ALDH1 (ALDH1+). To do this, we used the Aldefluor® reagent, which quantifies ALDH activity by measuring the conversion of the ALDH substrate BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde to the fluorescent product BODIPY aminoacetate (Figure 6A). Using HER2-overexpressing BT-474 cells as a breast cancer model naturally enriched with ALDH1+ cells, we detected a significant decrease (up to 63% reduction) in the number of ALDH1+ cells when BT-474 cells were treated with a non-cytotoxic concentration (10 μmol/L) of CHEMBL1950046 (hydroxytyrosol butyrate). A more pronounced effect was seen with CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), which significantly decreased the proportion of ALDH+ cells from 40±2% in untreated BT-474 cells to levels as low as 2±1% (96% reduction). To corroborate the ability of oleacein mimetics to target ALDH1+ epithelial-like CSC irrespective of the mutational landscape of cancer cells, we employed triple-negative MDA-MB-436 cells as a second breast cancer model naturally enriched with ALDH1+ cells. Treatment with hydroxytyrosol butyrate decreased the ALDH1+ cell content of MDA-MB-436 by approximately 40%. Remarkably, the large population of ALDH1+ cells in untreated MDA-MB-436 cultures (42±8%) was drastically reduced by 93% (from 42±8% to 3±1%) in the presence of (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide. Preservation of the oleacein binding mode is required for a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity but not for their anti-CSC behavior of oleacein mimetics. We finally evaluated whether the selected mimetics hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide preserved the dual anti-mTOR/DNMTactivity of the parental oleacein. We first employed the FRET-based Z-LYTE™ Kinase Assay to test the ability of the selected oleacein mimetics to inhibit mTOR activity. Ten concentrations of hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide spanning over five logarithmic decades were selected. Figure 6B shows the mTOR activity rate as a function of oleacein mimetics concentration. Hydroxytyrosol butyrate inhibited mTOR activity with an IC50 of ~39 μmol/L; (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide was unable to decrease mTOR activity even at the maximum concentration tested. We finally carried out a radioisotope-based methyltransferase profiling measuring the DNMT3A-catalyzed incorporation of S-adenosyl-L[methyl-3H]methionine (SAM[3H]) into DNA (DNA 5-[methyl-3H]-cytosine) in the absence or presence of oleacein mimetics. The selected oleacein mimetics were tested in 10-dose IC50 mode with 2-fold serial dilution and reactions were carried out at 1 μmol/L SAM. Although hydroxytyrosol butyrate decreased DNMT3A activity in a dose-dependent manner, concentrations higher than 150 μmol/L were necessary to reach the IC50 value. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide did not reach the half maximal inhibitory concentration of DNMT3a activity even at the highest concentration tested.

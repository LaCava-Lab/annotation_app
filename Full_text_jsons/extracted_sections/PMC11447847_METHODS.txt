Materials and Methods Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification TDP43RRM1 (101–192) The plasmid was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of TDP43RRM1–2 (101–277), containing both RRM domains, by changing the codon for amino acid V193 for the stop TAG codon. To construct the expression plasmid of TDP-43RRM1–2 tagged with N-terminal His6, DNA fragments encoding TDP-43 (101–277) were amplified from the template plasmid (Addgene 27462) and then ligated into EcoRI/AvrII digested pET302NT-His (Invitrogen). The TDP43RRM1 plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 star-competent cells and grown at 37 °C in Terrific Broth medium containing carbenicillin antibiotic. Cells were induced for expression with 1 mM IPTG when the OD600 reached between 0.8 and 1.0. Growth was allowed to continue overnight at 18 °C, and then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000×g for 20 min. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (1.5 M KCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM PMSF and the 1X Xpert protease inhibitor (GenDEPOT) and lysed by using a homogenizer (Avestin). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 1 h at 50,000×g. The supernatant was applied to nickel agarose beads (GoldBio) and washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole before elution with lysis buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. The elution was dialyzed to 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, concentrated to a 2 mL volume, and purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 75 column (Cytiva). CELF1RRM1–2 The His10-CELF1RRM1–2-expressing plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 star-competent cells and grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Cells were induced for expression with 0.4 mM IPTG when the OD600 reached between 0.8 and 1.0. Growth was allowed to continue overnight at 18 °C, and then cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000×g for 20 min. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 7.5) supplemented with a protease inhibitor (GoldBio Problock). The cell suspension was lysed using a homogenizer (Avestin). The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min to 1 h at 20,000×g. The cleared lysate is filtered to 0.45 μm using a vacuum filter and applied to Ni-NTA beads equilibrated with the lysis buffer. The beads were washed with 40 column volumes of the same lysis buffer with 1 M NaCl. The protein was eluted with an imidazole step gradient (100, 250, and 500 mM imidazole in 50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.5). Protein and DNA Concentration Determination Protein concentrations were calculated based on the UV absorbance extinction coefficient (ε, ml/(mg·cm)) at 280 nm: TDP43RRM1 = 1.16 and CELF1RRM1–2 = 0.49. Oligonucleotides (TG)6, (UGUU)4 were obtained from IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) and (GU)22, (GT)12 from Sigma. Oligonucleotide concentrations were calculated based on UV absorbance extinction coefficient (ε, ml/(mg·cm)) at 280 nm: (TG)6 = 18.21, (GT)12 = 18.12, (UGUU)4 = 14.03, and (GU)22 = 14.86. The molecular weights of the protein and RNA are summarized in Table S1. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) The EMSA binding reactions were prepared from 2-fold dilutions of protein:nucleic acid mix and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to gel electrophoresis. For nonfluorescent conjugated nucleic acid, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All gels were imaged by using ChemiDoc with appropriate filters. The protein concentrations, nucleic acid concentrations, and gel running conditions are as follows: TDP43RRM1 (1–8 μM); (TG)6 ssDNA (2 μM) or (TG)12 ssDNA (1 μM) in buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.3); 10% tris-glycine (TG, Bio-Rad) gel, 90 min at 100 V, 4 °C, in 0.5× TAE buffer. CELF1RRM1–2 (3–50 μM) and (UGUU)4 ssRNA (5 μM) in buffer (10 mM HEPES, 12.5 mM Tris, 70 mM NaCl, 12.5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP, pH 7.4); 10% Tris-Glycine (TG, Bio-Rad) gel, 60 min at 80 V, 4 °C, in 0.5× TAE buffer. CELF1RRM1–2 (4 nM–50 μM) and (GU)22 ssRNA (200 nM) in buffer (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.3); 10% TG (TG, Bio-Rad) gel, 90 min at 80 V, 4 °C, in 0.5× TAE buffer. Composition Gradient Multiangle Light Scattering (CG-MALS) Proteins were passed through size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75) prior to CG-MALS experiments to ensure the removal of high-MW aggregates. Proteins and oligos were diluted in experimental buffer (25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.3). CG-MALS data were collected using a fully automated three-syringe pump Calypso II instrumentation (Wyatt Technology, LLC) linked to a DAWN (Wyatt) multiangle light scattering detector equipped with a 661 nm laser and UV/vis detector (Agilent Technologies) collecting absorbance at 280 nm. Each experiment follows a concentration gradient of one species (A) to assess self-association, followed by a “crossover” gradient with varying concentrations of A and species B to characterize the heterointeractions, and finally, a concentration gradient of species B to assess its self-association. An example of one such experiment is shown in Figure S1. Initial concentrations for the different protein:nucleic acid complexes are approximately as follows: TDP43RRM1:(TG)6 are ∼24 μM and ∼14 μM, respectively; TDP43RRM1:(GT)12 are ∼21 μM and ∼5 μM, respectively; CELF1RRM1–2:(UGUU)4 are ∼9 μM and ∼19 μM, respectively; and CELF1RRM1–2:(GU)22 are ∼11 μM and ∼4 μM, respectively. Final protein and oligo concentrations were adjusted based on the UV absorbance signal detected in the CALYPSO software (Wyatt). Three replicates were performed. All analysis, including model fitting and data simulations, was performed using CALYPSO software (Wyatt). Light scattering data were fit to the following equations.where R is the Rayleigh ratio; Kij is the equilibrium association constant of the AiBj complex; A and B are constituent monomers; i and j represent the stoichiometric numbers of A and B in the AiBj complex; MA and MB are the molar masses of monomers A and B, respectively; and K* is a constant defined belowwhere (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment of a sample–solvent combination; n0 is the refractive index of the solvent; Na is Avogadro’s number; and λ0 is the vacuum wavelength of incident light.

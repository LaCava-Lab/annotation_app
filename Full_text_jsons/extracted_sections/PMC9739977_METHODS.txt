4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Materials The supply of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) was purchased from ChemFaces (Wuhan, China). Fura 2-AM (2-acetoxymethyl) and fibrinogen (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated) were purchased from Invitrogen (Eugene, OR, USA). A serotonin detection kit was purchased from Labor Diagnostika Nord GmbH and Co. (Nordhorn, Germany). Physiological agonists (collagen, U46619, and thrombin) were obtained from Chrono-Log Co. (Havertown, PA, USA). Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA, USA) supplied anti-phospho-p38MAPK, anti-phospho-inositol-3-phosphate receptor type I (Ser1756), anti-phospho-ERK (1/2), anti-phospho-VASP (Ser157), anti-phospho-cPLA2 (Ser505), anti-phosphor-PI3K (Tyr458), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-β-actin, and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. The thromboxane B2, cAMP, and ATP detection kit were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). 4.2. Human Platelet Aggregation The human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained from the Korean Red Cross Blood Center (Suwon, Korea). The platelets were then washed twice with washing buffer and resuspended in suspension buffer. The platelet suspension was adjusted to a concentration of 108/mL. Platelet suspensions (108/mL) were preincubated with 5-HI at 37 °C for 5 min, and then collagen, thrombin, and U46619 were added for platelet activation. Platelet aggregation was measured for five minutes. The change in the light transmission was calculated as the aggregation rate (%), 5-HI was dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and platelet aggregation was conducted using an aggregometer (Chrono-Log, Havertown, PA, USA). 4.3. Cytotoxicity Analysis Cytotoxicity was assessed using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage assay. Platelets (108/mL) were incubated with 5-HI for 20 min and incubated tubes were centrifuged at 12,000× g for supernatant. Lactate dehydrogenase was estimated using an ELISA reader (TECAN, Salzburg, Austria). 4.4. Ca2+ Analysis The Fura 2-AM (5 μM) and human PRP were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C, and platelet suspension was prepared. Platelets (108/mL) were preincubated with 5-HI for 5 min at 37 °C and stimulated with collagen (2.5 μg/mL) for Ca2+ mobilization. For Ca2+ influx detection, platelets (108/mL) were stimulated with thapsigargin (1 μM) in the presence of 100 μM of EGTA, and for thapsigargin stimulation, 2 mM of calcium was added at 3 min. The fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-2700, Tokyo, Japan) (Hitachi F-2700, Tokyo, Japan), and the [Ca2+]i values were calculated using the Grynkiewicz method. 4.5. Serotonin and ATP Analysis Platelets (108/mL) were preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 5-HI, and then stimulated with collagen (2.5 μg/mL) in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 to terminate ATP release, followed by centrifugation. The supernatant was used for detection of ATP release. The ATP luminescent assay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was detected using an ELISA reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). 4.6. Thromboxane B2 Analysis Because thromboxane A2 (TXA2) is quickly converted to thromboxane B2 (TXB2), TXA2 generation was measured by TXB2. After collagen-induced platelet aggregation with 5-HI, the reaction was terminated by indomethacin (0.2 mM), and the reaction tubes were centrifuged to obtain supernatant separation. TXB2 in the supernatant was detected using an ELISA reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). 4.7. Immunoblotting Analysis Collagen-induced platelet aggregation was terminated by adding lysis buffer, and proteins in the lysates were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). After sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto membranes and treated with primary and secondary antibodies. Detection was carried out in a dark room, and Western blotting bands were converted into a graph using the Quantity One program (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). 4.8. Fibronectin Adhesion Analysis Platelets (108/mL) were preincubated with 5-HI and CaCl2 (2 mM) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of collagen (2.5 μg/mL) and washed twice with PBS buffer, followed by the addition of cell stain solution. Extraction solution was added after a washing step, and supernatant was placed onto a 96-well plate. The plate was read at a wavelength of 560 nm using an ELISA reader (Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). 4.9. αIIb/β3 Activity Analysis Platelets (108/mL) were preincubated with 5-HI, and collagen-induced platelet aggregation was conducted with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated fibrinogen for 20 min. After aggregation, the reaction mixture was fixed with paraformaldehyde (0.5%). For the detection of αIIb/β3 activity, fixed platelet–fibrinogen was tested using flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). 4.10. Fibrin Clot Retraction For the fibrin clot retraction test, a human platelet-rich plasma (300 μL) was incubated with 5-HI for 30 min at 37 °C, and the clot reaction was triggered by thrombin (0.05 U/mL). After reacting for 15 min, pictures of fibrin clots were taken using a digital camera, and Image J (v1.46) was used for conversion to the clot area (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.11. Data Analyses All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation with various numbers of observations. To determine major differences among groups, analysis of variance was performed, followed by the Tukey–Kramer method. SPSS 21.0.0.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

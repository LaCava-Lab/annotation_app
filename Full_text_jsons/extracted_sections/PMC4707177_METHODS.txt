Experimental design, materials and methods Protein purification The cloning, expression, and the purification of isotopically enriched CupS protein has been reported recently. NMR spectroscopy The NMR experiments were performed on a sample containing 0.5 mM protein in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM deuterated dithiothreitol (DTT), and 10% D2O. All NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on BrukerBioSpin Avance-III 950, Avance-I 800, DRX-600, and DRX-500 spectrometers. The almost complete backbone and side chain chemical shift assignment has been reported recently. These chemical shifts and resonance assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/) under accession number 19971. In order to derive distance restraints for structure calculation, 15N-edited NOESY as well as 13C-edited NOESY spectra were recorded, each with a mixing time of 100 ms. Except for the one-dimensional 1H spectrum shown in Fig. 1 that was recorded with an 1-1 echo pulse sequence, most of the NMR experiments involved WATERGATE and water-flip-back methods for suppression of the water signal, except for 13C-edited NOESY spectra, which were measured in D2O-based buffer. Dihedral angles were obtained from TALOS+ employs Cα and Cβ chemical shift values.

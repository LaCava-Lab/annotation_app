2. Results 2.1. 5-HI Blocks Platelet Activity, Cytotoxicity, and Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) To evaluate the antiplatelet activity of 5-HI (Figure 1A), various agonists were used for platelet aggregation. Collagen (2.5 μg/mL)-, thrombin (0.05 U/mL)-, and U46619 (200 nM)-activated platelets formed maximal aggregation. However, 5-HI inhibited all agonists-induced platelet aggregation (Figure 1B–D), and among them, collagen-induced aggregation was the most strongly inhibited. The 5-HI treated platelets showed no cytotoxicity (Figure 1E), and IC50 was 112.4 (Figure 1F). 2.2. 5-HI Blocks [Ca2+]i Levels, IP3RI-, ERK-Phosphorylation, and Granule Release Next, intracellular calcium concentration and calcium-associated signaling molecules were evaluated. Collagen-induced intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) were elevated to 582.5 ± 8.2 nM, but 5-HI treated [Ca2+]i mobilization was strongly inhibited (Figure 2A). It is well-known that cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinases phosphorylate IP3RI and its phosphorylation lead to the inhibition of [Ca2+]i mobilization. Therefore, we investigated whether 5-HI can influence IP3RI phosphorylation, and we confirmed that 5-HI showed strong IP3RI phosphorylation (Figure 2B). Another pathway is Ca2+ influx, which also increases the [Ca2+]i level. Thus, we evaluated whether 5-HI can affect thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx via ERK phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 2C,D, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx was suppressed by 5-HI through ERK phosphorylation. Elevated [Ca2+]i concentration can facilitate the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and pleckstrin to trigger granule release. Therefore, we evaluated serotonin and ATP release from δ-granule. As shown in Figure 2E,F, 5-HI inhibited collagen-stimulated serotonin and ATP release dose-dependently. 2.3. 5-HI Blocks Thromboxane B2 Production and Dephosphorylation of cPLA2, p38MAPK The synthesis of prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid is promoted through cyclooxygenase-1, and prostaglandin H2 is changed into TXA2. The TXA2 is a positive feedback mediator produced following platelet activation and acts as an agonist through Gq-coupled TXA2 receptor. As shown in Figure 3A, collagen stimulation leads the TXA2 generation, but the production is inhibited by 5-HI. Next, we investigated TXA2-related signaling molecules such as cPLA2 and p38MAPK. As shown in Figure 3B,C, collagen-elevated cPLA2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation were inhibited by 5-HI. 2.4. 5-HI Blocks Fibronectin Adhesion, Fibrinogen Binding, VASP, PI3K, and Akt Phosphoryation αIIb/β3 is the essential tool of platelet adhesion, binding, and spreading and causes platelet–platelet interaction and thrombus formation. The αIIb/β3 can bind to various adhesion proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen; thus, we examined whether 5-HI-treated platelets can influence fibronectin adhesion. As shown in Figure 4A, the adhesion between platelets and fibronectin was inhibited by 5-HI. Next, we evaluated fibrinogen-binding action. Collagen induced the binding rate, which was 90.2 ± 2.5% (Figure 4Bb). However, 5-HI significantly decreased fibrinogen-binding action to αIIb/β3 (Figure 4Bc–f,C). Next, we investigated signaling molecules such as PI3K, Akt, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) connected with αIIb/β3. PI3K and Akt are mediators in platelets, leading to platelet shape change and αIIb/β3 activation. The interaction between agonists and platelets facilitate class I PI3Ks, leading to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate accumulation. Then, Akt binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate. At the same time, VASP regulates actin for αIIb/β3 activation, but its phosphorylation inhibits actin elongation. Our data showed that 5-HI significantly downregulated PI3K/Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4D,E) and upregulated VASP phosphorylation at Ser157 (Figure 4F). 2.5. 5-HI Elevated Cyclic Nucleotides and Suppressed Clot Retraction Next, we investigated cAMP and cGMP concentration in human platelets. Our result showed that 5-HI significantly increased cAMP levels (Figure 5A) but did not influence the cGMP level. Next, we investigated whether 5-HI affects fibrin clot retraction. As shown in Figure 5B, 5-HI effectively delayed clot formation, with inhibitory degrees of 60.6%, 50.8%, 40.5%, and 28.3%, respectively (Figure 5B,C). Y27632 was used as a positive control.

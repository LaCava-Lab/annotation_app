Material and methods Study design Nineteen MF patients and healthy volunteers (HC) vaccinated with mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (Spikevax mRNA-1273 or Comirnaty BNT162b2), were enrolled in the study ( Table 1 ). Patients with MF were treated with ruxolitinib (8/19; MF+Ruxo) or received hydroxyurea (HU)/supportive therapy only (11/19; MF-Ruxo,  Figure 1A ). mRNA vaccines were administered at day 0, 21/28 (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively) and 6 months after the second dose. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples were collected at baseline (hereafter indicated as pre v1), 7-30 days after the second vaccine dose (post v2), and 15 days after the third vaccine dose (post v3;  Figure 1B ) and tested for spike-specific antibodies, ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity and spike-specific B cells. The study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations, and the protocol was approved by the local Ethical Committee for Clinical experimentation of Regione Toscana Area Vasta Sud Est (CEAVSE), with the protocol code 19479 PATOVAC_COV v1.0, approved on March 15th 2021, and the protocol code 18869 IMMUNO_COV v1.0, approved on Novembrer 18th 2020. All subjects provided written informed consent before participation in the study. Inclusion criteria were confirmed diagnosis of MF, age ≥ 18 years, adhesion to the COVID-19 vaccination campaign; exclusion criteria included pregnancy, withdrawal of consent or refusal to participate, clinical problems for collecting additional blood samples beyond the amount required for routine care, participation to other clinical trials. Study participants without any sign or syntoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in anamnesis were recruited at the Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria Senese (Siena, Italy). Clinical data collection and management were carried out using the software REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture, Vanderbilt University). PBMCs isolation Venous blood samples were collected in a heparin coated blood tube (BD Vacutainer) at pre v1, post v2 and post v3. PBMCs were isolated by density-gradient sedimentation, using Ficoll-Paque (Lymphoprep, Voden Medical Instrument, Meda, Italy). Isolated PBMC were then cryopreserved in cell recovery medium [10% DMSO (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 90% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich)] and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Plasma samples were stored at −80°C. ELISA Maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 full spike protein (S1 + S2 ECD, Sino Biological) with 50 μL per well of 1 μg/mL protein solution in PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and left overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked at room temperature (RT) for 1 h with 200 μL of 5% skimmed milk powder (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany), 0.05% Tween 20, 1 × PBS. Heat-inactivated plasma samples were added and titrated in two-fold dilution in duplicate in 3% skimmed milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 × PBS (diluent buffer) and incubated 1 h at RT. Anti-human horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody for IgG (diluted 1:6000; Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL, USA) was added in diluent buffer for 1 h at RT. Plates were developed with 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 10 min at RT, followed by addition of 1M stop solution. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured on Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). WHO international positive control (plasma from vaccinated donor; NIBSC) and negative control (plasma from unvaccinated donor, NIBSC) were added in duplicate to each plate as internal controls for assay reproducibility. Antibody end point titers were expressed as the reciprocal of the sample dilution, reporting double the background OD value. A titre > 640 was considered as positive. ACE2/RBD binding inhibition assay ACE2/RBD binding inhibition was tested with the SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) kit (cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit, Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer protocol. Plasma samples, positive and negative controls were diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer, mixed 1:1 with HRP-RBD buffer and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. An amount of 100 µL of each mixture was added to each well of an ACE2-coated 96-well flat-bottom plate and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. After washing steps, the volume of 100 µL of TMB solution was added to each well and the plate was developed for 15 min at RT. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 µL of the stop solution to each well, and the OD at 450 nm was instantly read with Multiskan FC Microplate Photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Results of the ACE2/RBD inhibition assay were expressed as follows: percentage inhibition = (1 − sample OD value/negative control OD value) × 100. Inhibition values ≥30% was considered as positive results, and values <30% as negative results, as established by Tan at al and indicated by the manufacturer. Multiparametric flow cytometry A 7-color panel was developed to phenotype B-cell populations and identify SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells among PBMC by flow cytometry. The biotinylated spike proteins were tetramerized with fluorescently labeled streptavidin (SA) as follows: Spike S1+S2 ECD-His recombinant biotinylated-protein (Sino Biological) with SA-R-Phycoerythrin (PE), RBD recombinant biotinylated-protein (BioLegend) with SA-Allophycocyanin (APC). Two million PBMCs were incubated with BD human FC block (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at RT, and stained for 30 min at 4°C with the following antibody-fluorochrome panel: CD3-BV650 (clone SK7); CD19-BUV395 (clone SJ25C1), IgD-BV711 (clone IA6-2), CD20-APCH7 (clone 2H7), CD27-BV786 (clone M-T271), CD38-BUV737 (clone HB7, all from Becton Dickinson). Following surface staining, cells were washed once with PBS and labeled with Live/Dead Zombie according to the manufacturer instruction (Thermofisher). Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 100 µL BD fixation solution (BD Biosciences) and incubated at 4°C for 15 min in the dark. All antibodies were titrated for optimal dilution. About 1-2 × 106 cells were acquired and stored for each sample with SO LSRFortessa X20 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10 (TreeStar, USA). Statistical analysis Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post test for multiple comparisons, was used for assessing statistical differences between different groups for each time point. Unpaired Mann-Whitney test was used to assess statistical difference for each group at different time point. A p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

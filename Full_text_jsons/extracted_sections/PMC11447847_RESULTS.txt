Results and Discussion To evaluate CG-MALS as a method for characterizing multivalent interactions, we chose protein–nucleic acid pairs available to us. To avoid aggregation, we focused on truncated constructs: the first RRM domain of TDP43 (TDP43RRM1) and the first two RRM domains of CELF1 (CELF1RRM1–2). In all cases, at least two proteins are bound to each nucleic acid ligand. For two of the pairs, higher-order binding with four proteins per oligonucleotide was also present. The description and analysis for each of the protein–nucleic acid pair are detailed below. TDP43RRM1 Binding (TG)6 or (GT)12 ssDNA TDP43 is an RNA-binding protein, consisting of 2 RRM domains that recognize long GU repeats as well as single-strand DNA (ssDNA) TG repeats. For this study, we focus on TDP43RRM1 and assess its interaction with multivalent nucleic acid repeats (TG)6 and (GT)12. Both DNA sequences have been previously reported as TDP43 cognate sequences. TG repeat elements were found near the human CFTR exon 9 gene where TDP-43 can bind and regulate proper splicing activities to avoid exon skipping and ensure correct CFTR protein translation. In other ssDNA studies, TDP43 was demonstrated to form higher-order assemblies (up to four TDP43 RRM1–2) with 24 GT repeats. We set out to test how many domains might bind (TG)6 and (GT)12 sequences and with what affinity, i.e., if two molecules of TDP43RRM1 could bind to (TG)6, we expected four molecules to bind to (GT)12 DNA. EMSA provides qualitative evidence that TDP43 binds to both (TG)6 and (GT)12. For (TG)6, we observe the disappearance of the free ssDNA and the consequent smearing of the lanes with faint bands corresponding to bound states (Figure 1a). Similarly, for (GT)12, we observed binding and the appearance of a major distinct band and a minor more shifted band (Figure 1b). The more pronounced bands for (GT)12 suggest stronger binding and a tighter affinity. However, it is difficult to assess stoichiometry from these results. In contrast, the stoichiometry of the interactions is obvious when they are measured by CG-MALS (Figure 1c,d). Triplicate experiments were performed to investigate each interaction, each one consisting of three gradients, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Each experiment was fit separately, and we present the average and standard deviations of all measured and fit parameters. The measured Mw for each species (Table 1) was in good agreement with the expected monomer molar mass (Table S1). Concentration gradient data for the protein and nucleic acid species alone (i.e., in the absence of the binding partner) revealed no measurable change in Mw for concentrations up to 20 μM for TDP43RRM1, 30 μM for (TG)6, and 3.5 μM for (GT)12, confirming the lack of reversible self-association under the conditions tested. Although the measured Mw was slightly greater than the expected value, it was invariant with the concentration, indicating the presence of a small fraction of irreversible aggregates. Taken together, these results indicate that any change in Mw upon mixing protein and oligonucleotide resulted from the specific, reversible heteroassociation of the two species, and only these complexes were included when fitting the CG-MALS data. The heteroassociation gradients, which created 11 different combinations of protein and ssDNA, resulted in an increase in overall weight-average molar mass of the solution and indicated more than one protein bound to each ssDNA (Figure 1c,d). For (TG)6, the maximum measured weight-average molar mass (Mw) occurs when TDP43RRM1 is mixed with (TG)6 at a 2:1 molar ratio, with [TDP43RRM1] ∼ 14 μM and [(GT)6] ∼ 7 μM (Figure 1c), suggesting a 2:1 stoichiometry. The maximum Mw of 21.0 ± 1.8 kDa was consistent with two proteins bound to each oligonucleotide (Figure 1c), and this measured value was 40% higher than the Mw that would result in the absence of an interaction upon mixing these analytes at the same concentration (Figure 1c, gray dashed line). The best fit considers two binding sites with an equivalent affinity. Fitting three experiments independently resulted in an average equilibrium dissociation constant at each binding site of Kd = 10.4 ± 3.2 μM (Table 1). The concentrations of the complexes formed as a function of composition are shown in Figure 1e. Similar studies (TDP43RRM1 with sequence (GT)6) by ITC reported tighter affinities with Kd ∼ 100 nM for protein binding to the first site and Kd ∼ 10 nM to the second site, suggesting cooperativity between sites. The discrepancies could be attributed to the differences in sequence and experimental conditions. The ITC experiments were performed with lower buffer and salt concentrations (15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 25 mM KCl) versus our buffer conditions (25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.3). Also, since the CG-MALS experiments were conducted at concentrations from 3 to 30 μM (TG)6 and most of the protein-oligonucleotide mixtures were made in conditions of excess (TG)6 (Figure 1c,e), higher affinity interactions may have been masked, and the effect of cooperativity may have been negligible. For (GT)12, the measured Mw suggests higher-order binding and higher affinity compared to the interaction with (TG)6. Even at ∼10 times lower overall concentrations of oligonucleotides (i.e., concentrations up to 3.5 μM (GT)12 compared to concentrations up to 30 μM (GT)6), a significant increase in Mw is observed, reflecting both the increase in affinity and stoichiometry. The maximum measured Mw of 46.3 ± 1.9 occurs where [TDP43RRM1] = 4[(GT)12] = 8.3 μM (Figure 1d) and is significantly higher than the maximum possible Mw that could be achieved if each (GT)12 bound only two TDP43RRM1 at these concentrations (39 kDa), as shown by the green alternative nonfitting model in Figure 1d. Thus, the best fit is unambiguously consistent with four equivalent binding sites each with Kd = 1.34 ± 0.12 μM (Figure 1d, blue line), confirming a higher affinity for TDP43RRM1 as compared to (TG)6. The concentrations of each complex formed are shown in Figure 1f. Since the light scattering intensity measured by MALS is proportional to the weight-average molar mass, even a small amount of high-molecular-weight species can significantly impact the data, giving high confidence to the observation of the 4:1 species even at relative concentrations of 10% mol/mol or less. The RSD <10% on the Kd across three technical replicates further increases confidence in the fit. CELF1RRM1–2 Binding (UGUU)4 or (GU)22 ssRNA CELF1 is also an RNA-binding protein, consisting of 3 RRM domains with the N-terminal RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) separated from the C-terminal RRM3 via a long disordered linker. For the current studies, we focused on CELF1RRM1–2 and its interactions with its defined GU-rich target elements (GREs). Similar to the investigation of TDP43-binding ssDNA, we observed significant differences in both the stoichiometry and affinity for CELF1RRM1–2 depending on the length of the ssRNA binding partner. Similarly, we observed no significant self-association of either CELF1RRM1–2 or its binding partners. Initially, we investigated CELF1RRM1–2 binding to (UGUU)4. As expected, EMSA showed disappearance of free ssRNA and appearance of smeary band(s) that migrate higher upon increasing protein concentration but without clear insight into the stoichiometry. Triplicate CG-MALS experiments were performed to assess the interaction. In all three experiments, the maximum Mw (∼30 kDa) was achieved when the concentration of protein was approximately twice the concentration of ssRNA (overall mole fraction of CELF1RRM1–2 = [CELF1]/([CELF1]+[(UGUU)4]) ∼ 0.67), consistent with a 2:1 stoichiometry (Figure 2b). The best fit, considering all three experiments together, suggested two nonequivalent binding sites. CELF1RRM1–2 binds strongly at the first site with Kd ∼ 0.02 μM and more weakly to the second site with Kd ∼ 4 μM (Table 1). The results presented consider a single global fit to all three experiments. Significant experiment-to-experiment variation was observed, as seen in Figure 2b, likely due to the presence of aggregates in CELF1RRM1–2. Although CG-MALS confirmed an overall 2:1 stoichiometry for this interaction, the current data were insufficient to conclude whether the two binding sites are equivalent or nonequivalent, as shown by the comparison of the blue best fit line and the green alternative fit line in Figure 2b. However, a binding model considering two nonequivalent binding sites is consistent with literature studies, suggesting that the secondary site could accommodate only 1 RRM domain, resulting in a weaker affinity, and thus is presented as the best fit. We then investigated CELF1RRM1–2 interactions with the longer RNA (GU)22. With EMSA, we observed binding, which resulted in an upward shifting band. Importantly, the interaction appears to occur at lower concentrations of CELF1, compared with (UGUU)4, suggesting a higher affinity interaction (Figure 3a). With CG-MALS, we can fully quantify this interaction. The maximum measured Mw (86.1 ± 1.2 kDa) suggests that we can see the formation of at least a 4:1 stoichiometric CELF1RRM1–2:(GU)22 complex (Figure 3b). The best fit included the formation of three species with the following protein:ssRNA stoichiometry: 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 (Table 1). The maximum measured Mw is nearly 50% higher than the maximum possible Mw if only 2:1 binding is considered (Figure 3b, green line), clearly indicating that higher-order assemblies are reversibly formed under these conditions. The 1:1 and 2:1 complexes appear to form with equivalent affinity at each binding site (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.2 nM), which is over 1000× stronger than the affinity for CELFRRM1–2 for (UGUU)4. This might reflect an increase in cooperative binding affinities as expected for multivalent interactions. Under these conditions, a 4:1 complex also appears, and the third and fourth binding events were assumed to have equivalent affinity (Kd = 390 ± 30 nM). In general, we would also expect to observe the formation of the 3:1 complex; however, the model excluded the formation of this species, possibly due to the high concentration at which the measurements were performed (Figure 3c). It is possible that the 3:1 complex would also be evident at lower concentrations closer to Kd, where more binding sites would be unsaturated. In conclusion, we show that CG-MALS is an excellent technique for obtaining estimates of binding affinities and molecular stoichiometry associated with multivalent interactions. Even when the binding interactions become significantly more complex and involve high stoichiometric ratios (>2), the Mw,max can provide minimum estimates of molecular stoichiometric ratios. Better quantitative estimates can be obtained with CG-MALS data simulations and estimated Kd values from experimental studies for both simple stoichiometry (≤2) and complex interactions by combining data across multiple concentration ranges. Thus, CG-MALS could be a useful technique in investigating the molecular stoichiometry involved in large multivalent protein–nucleic acid complexes. The multivalent interactions of these transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins with nucleic acid repeat sequences are required for their cellular functions. CELF1 is linked to myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1 disease associated with the toxic effect of (CUG)n expansion. TDP-43 aberrant aggregation with RNA has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. There might be critical protein:RNA stoichiometry thresholds that may distinguish between physiological and pathological complexes and could benefit from the CG-MALS technique.

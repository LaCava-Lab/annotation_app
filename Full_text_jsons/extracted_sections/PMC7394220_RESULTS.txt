Results ASK-1/TNF-α Complex Increased in Ischemic Penumbra Figure 1A showed mice brain sections in response to MCAO at 24 h and the region of ischemic core and penumbra. Compared to the contralateral hemisphere, cleaved caspase-3 elevated in ischemic core and penumbra, indicating that apoptosis existed in these two regions. Besides, compared to brain tissue from control mouse, cleaved caspase-3 was significantly upregulated in ischemic penumbra (Figure 1B), as well as the expressions of total ASK-1 and pASK-1 (Figure 1C). There is no difference in the formation of ASK-1/STRAP/14-3-3 complex (Figure 1D), while the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex increased markedly in ischemic penumbra (Figure 1D). ASK-1 Expression Was Regulated by MLL1 We analyzed the spatial distribution of MLL1 in cerebral tissue of MCAO mouse. As the results showed, compared to the contralateral hemisphere, MLL1 expression was significantly upregulated in ischemic core and penumbra (Figure 2A). We next detected MLL1 expression in ischemic penumbra and mouse primary cortical mixed cells treated with OGD. Results showed that MLL1 expression was significantly upregulated in ischemic penumbra, as well as in cells treated with OGD (Figures 2B,D). CHIP assay showed that compared to control group, the recruitment of MLL1 to ASK-1 promoter region increased significantly in ischemic penumbra, as well as the H3K4 level in this region (Figure 2C). The same results were observed from mouse primary cortical mixed cells treated with OGD for 24 h (Figure 2E). The expression pattern of serum MLL1 in MCAO mice showed a rapid increase in the first 2 h, then kept a relatively stable level within 2–48 h, and the same expression pattern was observed in primary cortical mixed cells during OGD treatment (Figure 2F). Results of immunofluorescence showed that OGD could upregulate MLL1 and cleaved caspase-3 levels at the same cell, while siMLL1 could reverse these effects significantly (Figure 2G). MLL1 Was Essential for OGD-Induced Neuron Apoptosis Mouse primary cortical mixed cells were used to investigate the function of MLL1. As the results showed, OGD significantly upregulated the expression of MLL1, total ASK-1, pASK-1, and cleaved caspase-3, while siMLL1 and siASK-1 significantly reversed these effects. OGD enhanced the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex to promote cell apoptosis, and siMLL1 reversed the effects of OGD (Figure 3). Besides, overexpression of MLL1 and ASK-1 significantly increased total ASK-1, pASK-1, and cleaved caspase-3 expressions in primary cortical mixed cells, while siASK-1 blocked these effects induced by MLL1 overexpression. Overexpression of MLL1 further enhanced the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex and promoted apoptosis of primary cortical mixed cells (Figure 4). Inhibition of MLL1 Alleviated Neurological Damage Caused by IS We first analyzed whether MM102 could cross the BBB using an in vitro BBB model. The results showed that MM102 could penetrate the barrier consisting of BMECs and astrocytes to inhibit the interaction between MLL1 and WDR5 (Supplementary Figure S1C). Next, we designed three different concentrations of MM102 to investigate the effects of MLL1 inhibition in vivo. As the results showed, compared to the Veh group, using MM102 could significantly decrease infarct volume and the neurological score of MCAO mice (Figure 5). Serum MLL1 Level Was Significantly Correlated With the Severity of IS MLL1 expressions in mouse serum and brain tissue were detected by qPCR. As the results showed, MLL1 levels in both serum and brain tissues from the MCAO group were significantly higher than that in the control group (Figures 6A,B). Correlation analysis was performed to explore the association between MLL1 levels in serum and brain tissue. Results showed that serum MLL1 level in MCAO mouse was significantly correlated with that in ischemic core and penumbra (r = 0.874, P < 0.001, Figure 6C; r = 0.808, P = 0.005, Figure 6D), but not in normal cerebral tissue from control mice (r = −0.255, P = 0.472, Figure 6E). Besides, MCAO mouse serum MLL1 level was also positively correlated with the infarct volume and neurological score (r = 0.786, P = 0.007, Figure 6F; r = 0.852, P = 0.002, Figure 6G). We next analyzed serum MLL1 level in IS patients admitted to the hospital at different times, and no significant difference was found (Figure 6H; P = 0.428). However, we did find that the serum MLL1 level in IS patients was significantly higher than in controls (Figure 6I, P = 0.013). Correlation analysis showed that serum MLL1 level had no association with age, gender, and the disease subtypes (Supplementary Table S2) but was significantly correlated with disease severity. Seum MLL1 level was positively correlated with NIHSS score (r = 0.708, P < 0.001, Figure 6J), infarct volume (r = 0.613, P < 0.001, Figure 6K), and Hs-CRP level (r = 0.677, P < 0.001, Figure 6L). High MLL1 Expression Indicated Poor Prognosis of IS Patients Two hundred twenty-three patients discharged from the hospital were enrolled in the follow-up. Among them, 37 patients died within 24 months and three quitted the study. We divided patients into the high MLL1 group (H group) and the low MLL1 level group (L group) according to the median level of MLL1. Compared to patients with high MLL1 level, patients in L group had a significantly higher survival rate (P = 0.017, Figure 7A). For live patients, mRS was obtained at 24 months after hospitalization at the outpatient department. Results showed that high serum MLL1 level indicated an unfavorable functional outcome of IS patients within 24 months (r = 0.718, P < 0.001, Figure 7B).

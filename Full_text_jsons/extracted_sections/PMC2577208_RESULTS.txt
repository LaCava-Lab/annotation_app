RESULTS Identification of Ran as a Partner of VRK2B and VRK1 by Mass Spectrometry— To identify proteins that interact with members of the human VRK protein family an approach based on the use of a biochemical copurification of complexes using the GST affinity tag coupled with protein identification using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was followed (Fig 1A). For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with mammalian plasmids expressing fusion proteins GST-VRK1 or GST-VRK2B (the nuclear isoform of VRK2) that are identical and differ only in the last amino acid and with the empty vector expressing GST. The correct expression of the transfected proteins was confirmed in an immunoblot analysis (Fig 1B, left, and supplemental Fig S1A, left). Cell extracts were used for a pulldown of associated proteins using as control GST versus GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were separated by isoelectrofocusing followed by an electrophoresis in the second dimension. SYPRO Ruby staining allowed the detection of several different spots pulled down with GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1 but not with control GST that may correspond to proteins specifically bound to VRK proteins. In both cases, a ∼25-kDa spot was excised from gels for MS identification (Fig. 1B, right and supplemental Fig S1A, right). The analysis of the MALDI-TOF spectrum in each case showed several tryptic peptide masses that matched to theoretical masses from the Ran GTPase sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P62826) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1B). For the spot from the VRK2B pulldown, 12 of the 21 mass values searched matched with Ran, spanning 39% of the protein sequence (Fig. 1D) with a score of 170. For the spot from the VRK1 pulldown, 15 of the 23 mass values matched with Ran, covering 59% of the full-length protein (supplemental Fig. S1C) with a score of 229. Sequences corresponding to each tryptic peptide are shown (Fig. 1C, right, and supplemental Fig S1C). These data indicate that the protein selectively bound to VRK2B or VRK1 is Ran, the only known nuclear GTPase. These results suggested that Ran can interact with several members of the VRK family. In Vitro Interaction of the Three Human VRK Proteins with GST-Ran— To further confirm that all human VRK proteins or their isoforms were able to interact with Ran, in vitro pulldown experiments were performed. The HEK293T cell line was transfected with plasmids expressing either VRK1 or VRK2B and also VRK2A or VRK3. Cell extracts from transfected cells were used for a pulldown with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing either bacterially expressed GST-Ran or its mutants, GST-RanT24N that has a non-active conformation and mimics the GDP-bound state or RanL43E that mimics the GTP-bound active conformation and does not hydrolyze GTP. The GST-Ran proteins were used to bring down associated proteins that were detected in immunoblots with an anti-HA antibody specific for the HA epitope tag used in VRK proteins. The three GST-Ran proteins, wild type and both mutants, but not the GST control, were able to stably interact with VRK1 (Fig. 2A), VRK2B (Fig. 2B), VRK2A (Fig. 2C), and VRK3 (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the three human VRK proteins are able to interact with human Ran protein. Next whether VRK1 binding to Ran was concentration-dependent was tested. For this aim an in vitro interaction assay was performed using a non-limiting concentration of GST-Ran protein (80 nm) and increasing concentrations of VRK1 protein. The VRK1 bound to Ran was identified in an in vitro pulldown assay followed by an immunoblot. As the amount of VRK1-His increased so did the amount bound to GST-Ran (Fig. 2E), indicating that this interaction is direct and does not require any additional protein. Because the nucleotide loading of Ran might affect its interactions with other proteins such as VRK1, this in vitro interaction was also determined after loading Ran with either GDP or GTP to try to determine whether there were differences based on the bound nucleotide. GST-Ran and His-VRK1 were incubated in vitro under different conditions regarding the presence of nucleotide or EDTA. VRK1 was detected in the pulldown independently of the nucleotide present (Fig. 2F, the first two lanes with wild-type Ran), although it appeared to be stronger in the case of the inactive GST-RanT24N (Fig. 2F). Interaction of Endogenous VRK1 with GST-Ran— Endogenous VRK1 protein is expressed at significant levels in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A, top gel). Therefore extracts of this cell line were incubated with GST-Ran beads and used for a pulldown assay. The GST-Ran protein (Fig. 3A, left lane), but not the negative control GST (Fig. 3A, right lane), was able to specifically interact with human VRK1. Next to determine whether the conformation of Ran could significantly alter the interaction, a similar assay was performed using three different Ran proteins in the pulldown assay. The three Ran proteins, wild type, RanL43E and RanT24N mutants, were able to interact and brought down the endogenous VRK1 protein (Fig. 3B). To confirm this result, a reciprocal experiment was performed to determine whether the endogenous Ran protein was also able to interact with transfected VRK1. For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid pCEFL-GST-VRK1, and the expressed fusion GST-VRK1 protein was used for a pulldown experiment. In the lysate the expression of transfected proteins as well as endogenous Ran and its interacting protein RCC1 were determined (Fig. 3C, top). In the pulldown Ran was clearly detected in the corresponding immunoblot in which RCC1 was also present in this complex (Fig. 3C, bottom). To rule out that RCC1 does not directly interact with VRK1, a similar experiment was performed in which exogenous RCC1 was transfected (plasmid pGFP-RCC1) to displace endogenous RCC1 from the complex. This exogenous GFP-RCC1 protein did not displace the endogenous RCC1 from Ran, but it did compete with VRK1 for some of Ran because a smaller amount of Ran was detected bound to VRK1, and no GFP-RCC1 could be detected bound to VRK1 in the pulldown (Fig. 3D). Subcellular Localization of Endogenous VRK1 and Ran Proteins and Detection of Their Interaction by Reciprocal Immunoprecipitation— As an initial step, whether the two proteins, VRK1 and Ran, were at least partially colocalized within the cell was determined. The endogenous VRK1 and Ran proteins were detected by confocal immunofluorescence in HEK293T (Fig. 4A) and HeLa (not shown) cell lines. VRK1, detected with the polyclonal antibody VE1, was mostly localized in the nucleus, and some was localized in the cytosol. Ran was mostly cytosolic with some nuclear aggregation. Both proteins presented some overlap of their signals both in nucleus and cytosol in interphase (Fig. 4A). In cells that have finished cell division, Ran was mostly located on, or near, the nuclear membrane, but its overlap with VRK1 was intranuclear (Fig. 4B). To validate the interaction detected between Ran and VRK1, a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. The expression of the VRK1 and Ran proteins was first checked in the cell lysate (Fig. 4C, top gel). This extract was used for immunoprecipitation of Ran (Fig. 4C, bottom left) or VRK1 protein (Fig. 4C, bottom right). In each case a parallel immunoprecipitation with an antibody of the same isotype without an endogenous target was performed as negative control. VRK1 was detected in the Ran immunoprecipitate but not in the control with a nonspecific (anti-AU5) antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom left). Next the inverse experiment was performed, endogenous VRK1 was immunoprecipitated, and the Ran protein was detected in this specific immunoprecipitate but not in the case of the control with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom right). As a positive control, a parallel experiment was performed to check whether RCC1 was also detected as bound to immunoprecipitated Ran following the same experimental conditions used to see the interaction of VRK1 with immunoprecipitated Ran (Fig. 4D). Because VRK1 and VRK2 have a high conservation in their first 396 amino acids, whether there was an overlap between Ran and VRK2 was also tested. In the case of the endogenous VRK2 proteins the antibody cannot discriminate between its two isoforms because the sequence of isoform B corresponds to the first 397 amino acids of isoform A; therefore the signal has to be distributed in the cytosol and some in nuclei. In HEK293T cells there was a strong overlap between the cytosolic signal of VRK2 and Ran (Fig. 4E), suggesting that they might also be forming a complex in this compartment. Identification of the VRK1 Region Interacting with Ran— To identify the region of the VRK1 molecule required for the interaction with Ran, a pulldown with three different constructs of VRK1 as targets of GST-Ran was performed. The VRK1 regions were the full length (amino acids 1–396), amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–332), and carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 267–396) as well as the kinase-dead VRK1(K179E). The full length interacted very well, but there was a significant loss of binding with either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal region of VRK1, suggesting that they are much less efficient (Fig. 5A). These two constructs have an overlapping region corresponding to residues 267–332 (Fig. 5B). The interaction with kinase-dead VRK1 was also weaker probably because of the instability of this inactive protein that lacks autophosphorylation. VRK2B is almost identical in size and structure to VRK1 and thus behaved in a similar manner (not shown). A similar experiment was performed using fusion proteins spanning different regions of VRK2 expressed from plasmids pCEFL-GST-VRK2N (1–320), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C1 (256–508), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C2 (364–508), and pCEFL-GST-VRK2B-C (256–397). In VRK2 the overlapping region corresponds to residues 256–320 (Fig. 5, C and D). These regions in both VRK1 and VRK2 have a very flexible structure that can adapt alternative conformations, particularly when truncated at one end of the protein as these protein constructs are. The interaction of RanL43E with VRK1 occurs through the same region as that in Ran because both behave in a similar way (Fig. 5E). Also the conservation of the interaction region in the three VRK proteins suggests that they might compete with each other, as well as with other Ran-binding proteins containing the same motif, for binding to Ran. This was tested using VRK3, which was able to partially compete with VRK1 for the interaction with Ran (Fig. 5F). RCC1 and VRK1 Can Bind Simultaneously to Ran— The data available indicate that Ran is able to bind to its GEF, the RCC1 protein, and to VRK1 (this work); therefore it is possible that both proteins can bind simultaneously to Ran. First whether VRK1 could bind to RCC1 was determined in a pulldown assay. The GST-VRK1 protein was unable to bring down the RCC1 protein by itself (Fig. 6A) indicating that they do not appear to interact directly even if VRK1 is in a molar excess over RCC1. It is possible that when Ran is bound to RCC1 the formation of this complex might increase Ran affinity for its interaction partner VRK1. Thus when the Ran-RCC1 complex is formed there might be a change in conformation of Ran that increases its binding to VRK1 without displacing RCC1. If that interpretation is correct, in an experiment in which Ran and VRK1 were equimolar, the binding to VRK1 was determined as the amount of RCC1 was increased. In this case the VRK1 bound to Ran increased as the amount of RCC1 was raised (Fig. 6B). A similar result was also obtained when using a molar excess of Ran (not shown). These results indicate that the binding of Ran to RCC1 facilitates the incorporation of VRK1 into the complex. Ran and RCC1 Are Not Phosphorylated by VRK1 or VRK2B— Because VRK1 and VRK2B proteins have kinase activity, whether Ran was also a phosphorylation target of these kinases was tested. For this aim an in vitro kinase assay was performed using GST-VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S2A) or GST-VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S2B), and as substrates Ran, RanT24N, and RanL43E proteins were used. The autophosphorylation of VRK2B and VRK1 was used as positive controls. VRK2B and VRK1 did not phosphorylate any of the Ran proteins, but the positive control of kinase autophosphorylation was clearly detected. Ran is regulated by its interaction with its GEF factor, RCC1. RCC1 is regulated by phosphorylation in serine residues that inhibits its binding to importin and promotes its association required for spindle assembly. Therefore, the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 might be possible, and this was tested using a panel of RCC1 phosphorylation mutants in an in vitro kinase assay (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The same result was obtained with VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S3C).This phosphorylation was studied with and without the inclusion of different Ran mutants, but none of them were able to induce the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S3D). Therefore it can be concluded that VRK1 does not phosphorylate RCC1. Ran Down-regulates the Kinase Activity of VRK1 and VRK2B on Autophosphorylation and on Phosphorylation of Histone H3— Regulation of kinase activities is an alternative possibility resulting from a protein-protein interaction. The interaction between Ran and VRK1 might regulate the kinase activity of the latter. Therefore whether the kinase activity of VRK1 was affected by its interaction with Ran and whether it was dependent on any of the different forms of Ran were tested. For this aim two alternative assays were performed, autophosphorylation of VRK1 and phosphorylation of histone H3 in Ser-3 and Thr-10 by VRK1. Initially whether VRK1 autophosphorylation or H3 phosphorylation was affected by any of the different forms of Ran was determined. The kinetics of phosphorylation reaction is much faster than complex formation; therefore Ran and VRK1 were preincubated to form a complex before performing the kinase assay. VRK1 was able to autophosphorylate itself and phosphorylate H3, but these phosphorylations were inhibited by either wild-type Ran or the inactive RanT24N, whereas H3 was phosphorylated in the presence of the active RanL43E (Fig. 7A). Because RanL43E is able to stably bind GTP, the assay was also performed in its presence, but the result was similar to that without GTP (not shown). Next a dose-dependent phosphorylation of H3 by VRK1 was performed in an in vitro kinase assay, and at the higher VRK1 dose, Ran was added at different concentrations. Autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation were dependent on the amount of VRK1 (Fig. 7B). The addition of increasing amounts of Ran inhibited both VRK1 autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation. The inhibition of phosphorylation was dependent on the amount of Ran present in the assay (Fig. 7B). To determine whether a similar situation could be detected with the endogenous VRK1 kinase an experiment was performed in which the endogenous VRK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from either non-synchronized cells or cells blocked with nocodazole in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In the case of cells blocked in mitosis, there was an increase in autophosphorylation of VRK1 (Fig. 7C) as well as an increase in H3 phosphorylation, and both were inhibited by the inclusion of Ran protein in the assay (Fig. 7C, last two lanes). It has been reported that VRK1 phosphorylates histone H3 in Thr-3 and Ser-10. Therefore, whether these two residues were indeed phosphorylated by VRK1 was tested. The residues were detected using phosphospecific antibodies for each residue. An in vitro kinase assay was performed in the absence or presence of Ran (individual reaction components are shown in Fig. 7D, top), and the products were analyzed with the antibodies. VRK1 clearly phosphorylated H3 in Thr-3, which was reduced in the presence of Ran (Fig. 7D, bottom); however, the phosphorylation in Ser-10 was less noticeable because this antibody was much less efficient, although the phosphorylation signal also disappeared in the presence of Ran. From these experiments we can conclude that, in those complexes where VRK1 is interacting with Ran, VRK1 has a reduced kinase activity manifested both in its autophosphorylation and on its H3 specific target. Because VRK proteins, particularly VRK2 and VRK1, have a highly conserved amino-terminal region with their catalytic domain (397 amino acids), whether the kinase activity of both VRK2 isoforms was also inhibited by Ran was also determined (Fig. 7E). The kinase activity of both VRK2A and VRK2B in autophosphorylation and on H3 phosphorylation assays was inhibited by the Ran protein (Fig. 7E). VRK3 is a kinase-inactive protein, and it has been postulated that it can recover kinase activity by its interaction with an unknown protein. Therefore whether Ran could recover this activity was tested. An in vitro kinase assay was performed with VRK3 in the presence of the three forms of Ran; none of them recovered the kinase activity (Fig. 7E). Interaction of VRK1 with Ran Does Not Affect the Nucleotide Exchange Activity of RCC1— Because VRK1 is a nuclear protein the effect on the activity promoted by the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 was studied. One possible consequence of the interaction between VRK1 and Ran is to modulate the nucleotide exchange activity. To try to determine a possible effect, whether VRK1 could affect the release of GDP mediated by RCC1 was first determined. For this aim Ran was loaded with GDP, and the release of GDP was determined in the presence of different amounts of RCC1 with and without an excess of VRK1 protein. RCC1 induced a dose-dependent release of GDP that was not affected by VRK1 (Fig. 8A). Alternatively VRK1 might affect the loading of GTP on Ran induced by RCC1. This potential loading of GTP was studied at different time points using different concentrations of RCC1 with and without VRK1. RCC1 increased the amount of GTP bound to Ran in both a time- and an RCC1 dose-dependent way, but neither of them was affected by incubation in the presence of VRK1 (Fig. 8B). From these data it can be concluded that VRK1 does not affect the role of RCC1 in regulating the nucleotide exchange of Ran.

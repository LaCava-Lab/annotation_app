We recommend that investigators should report relative signal for a given assay run for a defined standard protein, not protein concentration. MW1 depletion of biosamples to measure wildtype HTT are incomplete and preferential rather than specific and likely still measure a mixture of wildtype and mutant HTT species. The community needs to consider alternative approaches for reliably measuring wildtype HTT levels. Detergent influences assay signal in HTT detection assays, calling into question common practices of detergent addition prior to long term storage, which would impact the ability to test-retest samples Detergent should be consistently added to samples prior to testing and long-term storage

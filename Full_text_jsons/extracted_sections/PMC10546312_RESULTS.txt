Results Design and selection of an optimized CAR targeting CD33 A panel of 12 different 4-1BB second-generation CAR constructs targeting CD33, derived from 2 different monoclonal antibodies (scFv from my96 and M195) and presenting hinge regions with different lengths from CD8a or IgG4 molecules were generated ( Figure S1A ). CAR design also included a truncated version of the human EGFR (hEGFRt) as a reporter gene to facilitate tracking of the CAR-T cells. The specific activation of the main signaling pathways (NFAT, NFkB, and AP1) after tumor recognition was measured using a triple reporter system in Jurkat cells (Jurkat-TPR). After transduction with lentiviral particles coding for the different CAR constructs Jurkat-TPR was cocultured with MOLM-13 cells, an AML cell line expressing CD33 established from the peripheral blood of an acute monocytic leukemia relapsed patient. Non-transduced cells (UTD) or transduced with a CAR targeting CD19 were used as controls. The top three CAR constructs [my96(45aa), my96(228aa), and M195(45aa)] showing the highest specificity without tonic signal were selected for further in vitro and in vivo functional analysis ( Figure S1B ). CAR-T cells with the selected CAR constructs were generated from healthy donors and functionally characterized. Transduction efficiency (CAR+ cells) and expansion capacity of CAR-T cells were similar between the three selected constructs. Evaluation of their in vitro lytic activity by regular cytotoxic assay against MOLM-13 cells showed that all three CAR-T cells effectively killed tumor cells at low E:T ratios. The in vivo antitumoral efficacy was evaluated in a xenograft model in NSG mice by administration of 3x106 CAR-T cells/animal 4 days after intravenous administration of 5x104 cells/animal MOLM-13 cells expressing luciferase. CAR-T cells derived from my96 antibody presented a statistically significant increased antitumor efficacy in vivo compared to M195(45) CAR-T cells. Finally, the my96(45) CAR, containing the 45aa hinge from CD8a, was selected for the rest of the studies ( Figures S1C–F ). CAR-T cells from AML patients are associated with decreased in vitro and in vivo functionality Since AML is associated with the presence of abnormal T cells phenotypes, we performed a phenotypic characterization of T cells collected from a cohort of 21 AML patients ( Table S5 ). When compared to T cells from young adults (below 30) or aged-matched healthy donors (senior), T cells from AML patients presented a more differentiated phenotype, particularly in the CD8+ compartment, with significant enrichment of effector (TE) cells. In contrast, T cells from healthy donors were enriched in naïve T cells (TN) ( Figures 1A, B ,  S2 ). Moreover, T cells from AML patients also displayed significantly higher expression of activation (CD69, HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD1, LAG3) markers compared to healthy donors ( Figures 1C ,  S2 ). To determine whether differences in phenotype and activation may play a role in the functionality of CAR-T cells, using our selected CAR construct, we generated CAR-T cells (CD33-CAR-T) from AML patients that were compared to CD33-CAR-T cells from young (adult) and elderly (senior) healthy donors ( Table S5 ). Non-transduced T cells (UTD) from each group were used as controls. The proliferation capacity of the CD33-CAR-T and UTD cells from the different groups was similar, reaching 4-5 population doublings during the expansion phase. Moreover, similar transduction efficiency was observed between the different groups, with around 50% of CAR+ cells, suggesting that transduction was not impaired in AML T cells ( Figures 2A, B ). Phenotypic analysis revealed that CD33-CAR-T cells from both senior donors and AML patients presented a statistically significant reduced percentage of memory stem (TSCM) and central memory T cells (TCM), with increased levels of activation markers like CD69 and HLA-DR. However, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented an increased proportion of terminal effector (TE) T cells, with higher levels of PD1 and LAG3 exhaustion markers ( Figures 2C, D ,  S3 ). Altogether, these data suggest that the initial T cell phenotype has a clear impact on the final phenotypic features of the CAR-T cells, with significant differences in the differentiation, activation, and exhaustion states produced by both age-related and AML-specific factors. Next, we decided to analyze the in vitro and in vivo functional capacity of the generated CAR-T cells. Regardless of their origin, all CD33-CAR-T cells were highly cytotoxic, producing similar levels of IFN-γ ( Figures 3A, B ,  S4 ). To further explore CAR-T cell functionality under more challenging conditions, a continuous repeated in vitro stimulation for 21 days with tumoral cells was performed. Under these conditions, we found that CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented a more exhausted phenotype, with increased PD1 and LAG3 expression, and a decreased proliferation potential that was statistically significant ( Figures 3C, D ,  S4 ). These features were also associated with reduced cytotoxic capacity after repeated restimulations ( Figure 3E ). The antitumoral potential of the CAR-T cells was then evaluated in vivo in a xenograft model of NSG mice transplanted with MOLM-13 cells, as described above. Treatment with all CD33-CAR-T cells significantly increased animal survival compared to UTD controls with no differences between male and female animals ( Figure S4 ). Interestingly, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients showed a statistically significant reduction of the antitumor activity with reduced survival compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors (adult and senior) ( Figure 3F ). To address whether the decreased capacity of CD33-CAR-T from AML patients could be reverted by modifying the design on the CAR construct, we replaced 4-1BB sequence by CD28 costimulatory domain and compared CD33-CAR-T cells generated from AML patients using both constructs. Similar transduction efficiency and proliferation potential were observed between 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells, with no differences in the phenotypic subpopulations, activation/exhaustion markers, cytotoxic capacity, or IFN-γ production after coculture with tumoral cells ( Figure S5 ). Finally, both 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells presented similar antitumoral efficacy in vivo in the xenograft model in NSG mice ( Figure S5 ). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the CD28 costimulatory domain does not improve the functionality of CAR-T cells from AML patients. Transcriptional characterization of CAR-T cells from AML patients Given the phenotypic and functional differences observed between CAR-T cells from AML patients and healthy donors, we further analyze CD4+ and CD8+ CD33-CAR-T cells at the transcriptomic level. RNAseq analysis before antigen recognition revealed that CAR-T cells from AML patients were transcriptionally similar to those from senior healthy donors, with only a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an FDR<0.05 and a |log2FC|>1 (31 for CD4+ and 12 for CD8+ CAR-T cells) ( Table S6 ). In contrast, most of the differences were observed when CAR-T cells from senior healthy donors and AML patients were compared to CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors (752 and 853 DEGs in CD4+ and 807 and 705 in CD8+ CAR-T cells respectively) ( Figure S6A ). All these differences were reflected in a principal components analysis where CAR-T cells from AML patients clustered together and close to those from senior healthy donors, being separated from CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors in both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cell subsets ( Figure 4A ). A closer analysis of the DEGs revealed that most of the differences observed with adult CAR-T cells were shared between senior and AML CAR-T cells, clearly indicating age-related differences. Thus, CAR-T cells from AML patients and senior healthy donors were enriched in genes related to activation, such as CIITA, with downregulation of genes associated with stem cell memory, like CD28 ( Figure 4B ,  S6D ). Moreover, gene ontology (GO) analysis of common DEGs showed enrichment in pathways related to the regulation of lymphocyte and T cell differentiation ( Figure S6C ), which would explain the more differentiated phenotype observed in the subpopulation analysis. Interestingly, we observed that about 30-40% of the DEGs between AML and adult CAR-T cells were unique to AML condition, indicating specific differences intrinsic to AML. We observed increased expression of genes related to lymphocyte exhaustion, such as LAG3 and NR4A1. Moreover, important genes related to T cell memory (BATF3, CCR7), T cell differentiation (GATA3), apoptosis (BAX, BCL family), or IFN response (OAS1) were also deregulated ( Figure 4C ,  S6E ). In accordance, GO analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to lymphocyte activation, response to stress and DNA damage, regulation of the immune response, antigen receptor-mediated signaling, and regulation of the cell cycle ( Figure S6C ). We further characterized CAR-T cells from AML patients upon stimulation with tumoral cells. Two weeks after stimulation we observed a set of genes presenting disrupted expression patterns (different behavior after stimulation) compared to adult and senior CAR-T cells ( Figures 4D ,  S6F ). Those genes were related to CAR-T cell migration and cell adhesion (CD81, CCL5, MMP25), proliferation (IRF1, CCR7), or regulation of cytokine production (KLF2, IL32), which would explain the reduced proliferation potential and antitumoral efficacy of these AML CAR-T cells. Altogether, these data suggest that CAR-T cells from AML patients present dysfunctional features already identified in the initial T cells, exacerbated after tumor recognition that may compromise the long-term antitumoral efficacy. Generation and characterization of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T cells Due to the reduced potential of the CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients and, in no less measure, the fact that delaying treatment in patients with AML may be unacceptable, we decided to approach these issues by generating allogeneic CD33-CAR-T cells. To prevent the immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) associated with allogeneic cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout HLA-I and TCR expression. First, we designed different single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and exon 1 of T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus, and we selected three sgRNAs based on their location and the predicted on-target/off-target efficiency ( Table S3 ). Cleavage efficiency was evaluated in vitro by TIDE after transfection of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) in the Jurkat cell line. β2M-sgRNA3 and TRAC-sgRNA2 were selected for further studies since they presented the highest cleavage efficacy, inducing frameshift mutations (mostly 1nt insertions) that resulted in the reduction of HLA-I and TCR levels ( Figure S7 ). Then, selected CRISPR RNPs were combined with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system to generate HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T (CAR-TKO) cells from healthy donors. The transposon vector containing the selected CD33 targeting CAR construct was used as minicircle (MC) and the SB100X transposase was provided as mRNA. Our optimized protocol allowed in a single electroporation an efficient depletion of HLA-I and TCR complexes, with more than 69% of double negative cells, and an efficient CAR delivery, that was slightly reduced when CAR and RNP were delivered together (average of 46.8% vs 32.4%) ( Figures 5A, B ,  S8 ). Genome-edited CD33-CAR-T cells were further purified using magnetic beads which yielded >98% double-negative cells while maintaining the percentage of transduction (CAR+ cells) ( Figures 5C, D ,  S8 ). The proliferation capacity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells, although not significant, was slightly reduced compared to non-edited CAR-T cells, an effect that was also observed in UTDKO cells, consistent with the effect of electroporation ( Figure 5E ). Moreover, no differences were observed in terms of CD4/CD8 ratio, population subsets, or the expression of activation and exhaustion markers ( Figures 5F, G ,  S9 ), indicating that HLA-I and TCR depletion did not affect CAR-T cell phenotype. Then in vitro cytotoxicity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells against MOLM-13 cells was equivalent to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure 5H ). Moreover, although proliferation was slightly reduced after continuous restimulation with tumoral cells, CD33-CAR-TKO cells also presented similar cytotoxic activity to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure S9 ). Finally, although the in vivo antitumoral potential in a xenograft model in NSG mice was slightly reduced compared to previous results, where some total remissions were observed, no differences were observed between CD33-CAR-TKO and CD33-CAR-T cells ( Figures 5I ,  S9 ). These results indicate that CD33-CAR-TKO cells generated from healthy donors could be an efficient approach to overcome dysfunctional features observed in CAR-T cells from AML patients. Safety analysis of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T cells The safety of edited cells remains a concern for human application. Analysis of genomic DNA found a similar number of transposon copies in CD33-CAR-TKO cells compared to non-edited CAR-T cells generated with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, with an average of 7.3 and 7.5 respectively ( Figure 6A ). Moreover, integration site analysis revealed a safe integration profile of the CAR, with no differences due to CRISPR modifications. We mapped and characterized a total of 94148 unique insertion sites of three independent CD33-CAR-TKO and CAR-T cell productions. Most of the insertions were located at the expected AT-rich DNA regions of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, detecting the palindromic ATATATAT motif, which contains the TA dinucleotide target sequence adjacent to all the insertions ( Figure S10 ). Moreover, CAR insertions presented a wide distribution within the genome, with no preferences for promoter or exonic regions, and most of the insertions were located at distal intergenic regions ( Figures 6B ,  S10 ). An additional potential issue associated with CRISPR-based genome editing would be the genotoxicity due to non-specific cleavage of the genome. Thus, we used iGUIDE, a modification of the GUIDE-seq method, to analyze the CRISPR-mediated cleavage specificity. We observed a highly specific editing of the β2M and TRAC locus, with no significant off-target sites ( Figure 6C ). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that CRISPR-mediated HLA-I and TCR knockout do not alter the safe integration profile of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system without inducing unspecific cleavage of the DNA. Preclinical production of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T cells Finally, to determine the feasibility and consistency of the process for further clinical application, we optimized the production of edited CD33-CAR-TKO cells at a large scale. Thus, 50x106 T cells were electroporated with equivalent scaled proportions of Sleeping Beauty transposon system (MC + mRNA) and RNP (Cas9 + sgRNA). Electroporated CAR-T cells were expanded using the G-Rex platform and CD33-CAR-TKO cells were selected at the end of the expansion phase using AutoMACS. No differences were observed in editing efficiency before CD33-CAR-TKO cell selection, with more than 70% of double negative cells, or in the purity of selected cells ( Figure 7A ). The analysis of the purified CD33-CAR-TKO cells revealed no differences in the transduction efficiency and expansion capacity (population doublings), allowing the generation of at least >300x106 of purified CD33-CAR-TKO cells at the end of the procedure ( Figures 7B–D ). Moreover, CD33-CAR-TKO cells produced at the large scale were equally functional in terms of cytotoxic activity and IFN-γ production than previously produced CD33-CAR-TKO cells ( Figures 7E, F ). In summary, we have successfully developed a protocol for the efficient production and selection of fully functional gene-edited CAR-T cells, allowing the generation of large numbers of CD33-CAR-TKO cells, that could be compatible with clinical applications.

Results Ischemic Insult Mediates a Significant Downregulation of ZnT8, in vivo  The retinal ZnT8 mRNA gene expression levels were evaluated on P17, by real time RT-PCR. Data were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. By using the primers shown in Fig. 1A; our data revealed that there was a significant (**P<0.01) downregulation in the message levels in the non-treated oxygen-injured retinas (Fig. 1B: Red Bar) (2.96±0.02) and DMSO-treated retinas (Fig. 1B: Orange Bar) (3.08±0.01) as compared with the retinas from animals that were placed under ambient conditions (Fig. 1B: Blue Bar) and retinas from animals that were treated with 100 µM YC-1 (Fig. 1B: Green Bar). Therefore, the effects of sham treatment on the ZnT8 gene expression patterns paralleled those seen in the ischemic group. Characterization of ZnT8-immunoreactivity in the Mouse Retina Our immunohistochemistry data have indicated that the ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the normoxic retinas exhibited the strongest ZnT8 immunoexpression, whereas the PRL, INL and IPL showed moderate ZnT8 staining (Fig.1C; 2A; 3A; 3B). Based on their location, these cells were presumed to be amacrine and horizontal cells. Furthermore, since both NFL and INL exhibited ZnT8 reactivity; this suggests that both the axons and dendrites of ganglion cells contain ZnT8. Our immunohistochemical data have also demonstrated that ischemic insult has mediated a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the protein level, in vivo (Fig. 2B; 3A; and 3B). The ZnT8-depleted cells were primarily localized in the photoreceptor layers/neurosensory retina (Fig. 2B; 2C). The nontreated O2-injured (Fig. 2B) and the DMSO-treated O2-injured retinas (Fig. 2C) exhibited a weak “focal”, sporadic staining signals for ZnT8 reactivity, which was primarily localized in the PRL, ONL, INL, GCL and the NFL regions. Ischemic injury has inflicted a significant (**P<0.01) downregulation of ZnT8 protein levels in the non-treated ischemic (5.38±20) as compared to normoxic retinas. In addition, ZnT8 expression was significantly (**P<0.01) downregulated in the DMSO-treated retinas (5.22±0.01) as compared with the retinas from animals that were placed under ambient conditions (Fig. 3B). YC-1 Curtails Ischemia-Induced Downregulation of Basal ZnT8 Expression at the Message and the Protein Levels, in vivo  Our data have demonstrated that treatment with a double intravitreal injection-regimen of YC-1 (100 µM) on P12 and P15 resulted in significant (**P<0.01) upregulation in the ZnT8 message level as compared with DMSO-treated ischemic retinas, and its expression level was comparable to that of the normoxic group (Fig. 1B: Green Bar). Furthermore, YC-1 treatment restores the ZnT8 expression to basal homeostatic level, which was comparable to those of the nontreated normoxic retinas (Fig. 2D; 3A; 3B). YC-1-treated retinas displayed a significant upregulation in ZnT8 immunoexpression as compared to DMSO-treated retinas. YC-1-treated retinas exhibited a significant (**P<0.01) elevation of ZnT8 expression and strong staining signals of ZnT8 expression, primarily in the ONL, OPL, GCL and NFL, whereas the PRL, INL, IPL expressed moderate levels of ZnT8 immunoreactivity. The staining intensity of ZnT8 in the YC-1-treated retinas was strong and significantly elevated by 5 folds as compared with DMSO-treated-injured retinas. Hypoxia Induces ZnT8 Depletion in Müller Cells, Whereas YC-1 Restores Basal ZnT8 Homeostasis, in vitro  Since the above data have revealed that ZnT8 was primarily expressed in the PRL, ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the normoxic and YC-1-treated retinas. Ergo in view of the fact that glial cells extend from the INL to the outer limiting membrane (OLM); the possibility existed that YC-1 maybe acting directly on retinal glial cells. We therefore, used rMC-1 cells (Müller cell line) to study the direct effects of YC-1 on ZnT8 mRNA expression. Real time RT PCR was employed to investigate the changes of ZnT8 mRNA expression in the Müller cells. Post-exposure to hypoxia for 48 hrs, rMC-1 cells (Fig. 4A: Red Bar) revealed statistically significant downregulation in ZnT8 mRNA level as compared to cells cultured under normoxia, which displayed high ZnT8 mRNA levels (Fig. 4A: Blue Bar). Under hypoxic conditions, the expression of ZnT8 was decreased by 3.1±0.7 folds, compared to normoxia. Treatment with DMSO did not influence the levels of ZnT8 expression (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar). The expression of ZnT8 in DMSO-treated rMC1 cells was 3.02±0.2 folds lower than normoxic controls (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar). Treatment of rMC1 with 25, 50, 75, and 100 µM YC-1 resulted in a significant dose-dependent upregulation of ZnT8 expression under hypoxia, as compared with the corresponding DMSO-treated hypoxic control cells (Fig. 4A: Green Bar). Data were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 4A, real-time PCR assay elucidated the expression of ZnT8 was significantly suppressed by hypoxic conditions, whereas the inhibitory effect was dramatically compromised and reversed in the presence of the HIF-1 inhibitor, YC-1. Taken together, our Real time RT-PCR data have revealed that post hypoxic exposure, the level of ZnT8 mRNA expression was significantly (***P<0.001) downregulated, as compared to the normoxic control (Fig. 4A: Red Bar). DMSO-treatment had no effect on the ZnT8 gene expression pattern in rMC-1 cells and it paralleled those in nontreated hypoxic cells (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar). Western immunoblot analysis was performed. rMC-1 cells cultured under normoxia exhibited high signals of ZnT8, while this signal was downregulated after 48 hrs of hypoxic exposure as compared to normoxic control (Fig. 4B). In the DMSO-treated hypoxic cells, ZnT8 protein expression profile was compatible to the ZnT8 expression that was characterized in non-treated hypoxic cells. YC-1 treatment induced an augmentation in the hypoxia-downregulated ZnT8 protein levels in a concentration-dependent fashion, as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic cells (Fig. 4B and 4C). In the DMSO-treated cells, ZnT8 protein levels remained comparable to non-treated cells that were cultured under hypoxic conditions. Since YC-1 treatment did not inhibit β-actin, this indicates that YC-1 influence on ZnT8 protein expression was specific. Our densitometry analysis indicated that ZnT8 protein expression was significantly downregulated in hypoxic cells, as compared to cells incubated under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4C). Direct measurements of protein levels by Western blot indicated that under hypoxic conditions; ZnT8 protein expression was significantly decreased by 10 fold, compared to normoxia; whereas treatment with 100 µM significantly upregulated ZnT8 expression by 8 folds in rMC-1 cells, compared to non-treated hypoxic cells, (***P<0.001) (Fig. 4C).

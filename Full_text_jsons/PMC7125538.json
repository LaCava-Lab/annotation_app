Previous studies reported that HA Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations increased viral binding affinity for \u03b12,6 Sia. Therefore, rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D1128\u0394/I151T were generated by introducing the Q192H and 128\u0394/I151T mutations into EG/D1 HA to produce representative interphyletic viruses for this study. The virus binding assays showed that Suita/117 and Japan/434 had binding specificity for \u03b12,6 Sia ( Fig. 2A and B).

This was in agreement with the previous report that sublineage A/B viruses have generally acquired an increased human-type receptor binding affinity. In contrast, all the H5N1 strains that were isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia showed typical bird-type receptor specificity. Several variant-type strains with increased \u03b12,6 Sia binding affinity have been reported in some Asian countries. However, acquisition of human-type receptor affinity by Asian H5N1 viruses seemed to be strain-specific, which may explain why the Asian H5N1 viruses tested in this study did not show dual receptor specificity. Further evaluation of the test strips using larger numbers of Asian H5N1 strains may detect interphyletic viruses in these areas.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 29775, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, two H5N1 virus strains produced no visible test lines on either \u03b12,3 Sia or \u03b12,6 Sia test strips (Table 1), even though the titers of these viruses were >128 HAU. Epidemiological studies have reported a few exceptional virus strains that recognized distinct sialylglycan topologies. Thus, these two viruses may have such an exceptional receptor binding specificity. However, these viruses may not have bound the C179 antibody due to amino acid change(s) at the antigen epitope in the HA stem region.

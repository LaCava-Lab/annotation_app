NO serves as a secondary messenger by activating soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), inducing a downstream pathway that leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. The mode of action of NO involves coordination to a heme-iron in the active site of sGC. Since these initial discoveries, the role of nitric oxide in biology has been studied extensively. A small free radical, NO elicits many physiological events. As for all signaling agents, NO homeostasis is crucial to its proper function, and misregulation of NO production is implicated in a large number of pathologies. In order to study the many roles of NO in biology, we are pursuing a dual strategy whereby we employ both cellular fluorescence imaging to monitor endogenously produced NO in a variety of biological contexts and we apply synthetic coordination chemistry to study the fundamental reactivity of NO with non-heme iron-sulfur complexes as biomimics of its cellular targets.

The electron-rich vicinal amines alter the energy of the frontier orbitals in such a way as to facilitate PeT. In the presence of NO oxidized to N2O3, an electron-poor aryl triazole is formed, which sufficiently alters the energy of the frontier orbitals to abolish the PeT pathway and restore emission.

Upon exposure to excess nitric oxide, there is an immediate 11\u00b12-fold increase in fluorescence that is complete within 5 min (16\u00b11-fold total fluorescence enhancement). CuFL1 is selective for NO over a wide range of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), including nitrate, nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, peroxynitrite, superoxide, and nitroxyl. Importantly, endogenously produced NO can be visualized using CuFL1 in both iNOS- and cNOS-expressing cell lines in a time-dependent fashion when incubated with the appropriate NOS-inducing agent (Figure 1). Recently, a Cu(II) complex of 4-methoxy-2-(1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenol (MNIP) operating by the same mechanism as CuFL1 was employed as a NO-specific probe in liver slices to study NO-induced inflammation during hepatic injury, demonstrating the applicability of this strategy in ex vivo tissue experiments.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9793, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The mechanism by which fluorescence enhancement occurs when CuFL1 is exposed to nitric oxide involves nitrosation of the secondary amine of the ligand and loss of copper. The ligand by itself is only weakly fluorescent. DFT calculations suggest that quenching of FL1 is due to PeT from one of the lone pair electrons on the aminoquinaldine into a half-filled fluorescein molecular orbital in the excited state. This electron-transfer event is possible because the lone pair of the aniline nitrogen atom on the quinoline (HOMO-1 orbital) occupies an sp orbital that is similar in energy to that of the HOMO orbital (Figure 2a). In the excited state, when electronic relaxation of the HOMO orbital occurs, the HOMO-1 orbital remains largely undisturbed because the nitrogen lone pair is delocalized onto the quinoline ring and increases in energy due to \u03c0-antibonding interactions (Figure 2b). As a result, the HOMO-1 orbital is higher in energy than the half-filled HOMO orbital in the excited state and therefore a competent donor orbital for PeT quenching. The emission of the ligand is further reduced when it forms a Cu(II) complex, due to the quenching by the paramagnetic center. Fluorescence studies confirmed that it is the CuFL1 complex, not the FL1 ligand, which senses NO. EPR experiments revealed that Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) during the reaction, but formation of a diamagnetic metal species alone is not responsible for the fluorescence enhancement because of PeT-induced self-quenching of the ligand. LC-MS and UV-vis studies of the product of the reaction revealed that Cu(I) is released and an N-nitrosated version of the ligand, FL1-NO, is formed. MS and UV-vis spectroscopic characterization of independently synthesized FL1-NO corroborated these results. 15N NMR spectral characterization of the product of the reaction of FL1 with 15NO2 under acidic conditions confirmed that the ligand could be nitrosated at the secondary amine to produce an emissive derivative, FL1-NO. The quantum yield of FL1-NO is 7.5-fold greater than that of FL1 and 9.2-fold greater than that of the copper complex, supporting the conclusion that FL1-NO is the species responsible for the fluorescence emission in these reactions. DFT calculations confirmed that FL1-NO has lost the ability to self-quench. When the aniline nitrogen atom is nitrosated, it adopts a trigonal planar geometry (Figure 2a), causing the molecular orbital containing the lone pair of the quinoline (HOMO-14 orbital) to be much lower in energy than in the un-nitrosated version (Figure 2b). The interaction of the lone pair on the aniline nitrogen atom with the \u03c0-system of the quinoline ring is attenuated by comparison to the situation in FL1. Instead, it delocalizes into the \u03c0-system of the formally NO+ fragment, producing a stabilized NO moiety of lower energy. It is assumed that this situation will also apply to the excited state, which would cause FL1-NO to emit.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12744, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There is more than one plausible intimate mechanism for this reaction. It is possible that, upon exposure of CuFL1 to NO, a transient copper-nitrosyl forms with attendant reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and oxidation of NO to NO+. Upon deprotonation of the ligand aniline nitrogen atom, the NO+ would nitrosate the amine, resulting in ligand dissociation from the metal (Scheme 3a). It is possible that, instead of direct Cu(II)-NO bond formation, outer sphere electron transfer from NO occurs to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), forming NO+, which reacts with the ligand upon deprotonation. An alternative mechanism involves initial deprotonation of the aniline nitrogen atom, followed by attack of NO at that site to form the N-nitrosamine. Subsequent inner-sphere electron transfer to copper by the coordinated amido ligand would result in reduction to Cu(I) and ligand dissociation (Scheme 3b). Another possible result of ligand deprotonation is conversion of the resulting Cu(II)-NR2 to an aminyl radical Cu(I)\u2013\u00b7NR2 species, which would readily react with NO. The mechanism by which a copper(II) dianthracenyl-cyclam complex (CuDAC) reacts with NO in a manner similar to CuFL1 has been investigated. CuDAC, like CuFL1, is non-emissive in the absence of NO, but in its presence fluoresces due to reduction of the paramagnetic Cu(II) center. Like CuFL1, the DAC ligand is N-nitrosated and dissociates from the metal center after reaction with NO. The reaction of CuDAC and NO is pH-dependent, and no copper-nitrosyl was observed during infrared studies of the complex. These results support a reaction mechanism like the second postulated scenario for CuFL1 (Scheme 3b).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14409, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Application of CuFL1: Determination of NO as a Virulence Factor in Bacillus anthracis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14495, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Most nitric oxide produced in vivo is generated by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO via N-hydroxy-L-arginine. In eukaryotes, there are two major classes of the enzyme (euNOSes), constitutive and inducible, which produce different concentrations of NO after induction by different stimuli. Neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) nitric oxide synthases represent the constitutive forms of the enzyme (cNOS). They require activation to produce NO, a process that occurs after an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration activates calmodulin (CaM). Calcium binding to CaM induces a conformational change in this protein, which primes it for subsequent action on a variety of targets, including nNOS and eNOS, activating their catalytic functions. The NO-forming reaction occurs in the oxidase domain of cNOSes, which contains a heme responsible for L-arginine hydroxylation. A reductase domain supplies electrons required for turnover. The electrons are shuttled from flavin moieties in the reductase to the heme center after calmodulin binding alters the protein conformation to bring the oxidase and reductase domains into close proximity. Recently, a NOS from the Gram-negative bacterium Sorangium cellulosum has been isolated that is similar to eukaryotic NOSes. This enzyme uses a 2Fe2S ferrodoxin domain in the reductase instead of flavins to transfer electrons, and it utilizes either tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) or tetrahydrofolate (H4F) as cofactors, rather than only H4B in the euNOSes. Many Gram-positive bacteria also express a nitric oxide synthase, bNOS, which contains an oxidase that is homologous to that of the euNOSes. These enzymes differ from the eukaryotic ones because they lack a reductase domain in the protein. As a result, it was long thought that bNOS-expressing bacteria were incapable of producing NO in vivo. However, NO production has been demonstrated by three Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, and Staphylococcus aureus. It is hypothesized that these bNOS-expressing bacteria recruit non-committed reductases to provide electrons for catalysis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16665, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Anthrax infection is caused by Bacillus anthracis, one of the NO-generating bacteria. Cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation anthrax infections are all potentially fatal, but inhalation anthrax is the most deadly because of its ease of spread, rapid uptake into the body, and potent action. When these bacteria enter the body they are taken up by the host\u2019s macrophage cells, which attempt to kill the bacteria by attacking them with an onslaught of reactive oxygen species including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. B. anthracis is potent in part because it can defend itself against such an attack by using nitric oxide as an important virulence factor. B. anthracis (Sterne) pre-treated with NO have increased viability against hydrogen peroxide exposure and a bNOS deficient strain of the bacterium has increased susceptibility to attack by cultured macrophages. Moreover, the bNOS knockout strain of B. anthracis exhibits reduced virulence in mice. It is hypothesized that the bacterium uses NO in a dual mechanism to assuage attack by the host. Firstly, NO activates bacterial catalase, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide to water and dioxygen. Secondly, NO helps to suppress Fenton chemistry, thereby reducing hydroxyl radical production and subsequent nucleic acid, protein and lipid damage. In order for Fenton chemistry to operate catalytically, the ferric iron generated in the reaction must be converted back to ferrous iron, a process that is accomplished by using cysteine as the reductant in bacteria. Nitric oxide inhibits the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxRed) system, the only system for thiol reduction in many bacteria. NO-mediated protection is crucial to bacterial survival because it does not rely on the initiation of protein synthesis, which is time- and energy-consuming.

Because the bNOS enzyme lacks a reductase domain it is possible that inhibition of the reduction step would prove to be useful as a strategy for selective inhibition of bNOS. Using CuFL1, a protocol for measuring NO production in E. coli transfected with the B. anthracis bNOS was established. This protocol revealed that the NO production times in bacteria vs. macrophages are very different. The latter use inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which, unlike cNOSes, must be activated by immunogenic agents, such as cytokines. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is regulated at the transcription level and its basal expression levels are negligible.

We have not been able to observe any intermediates in this reaction nor have we identified the allotrope of sulfur that is formed. Addition of fewer than four equivalents of NO to solutions of [Fe2S2(SPh)4]2\u2212 results in a mixture of [Fe(NO)2(SPh)2]\u2212 and unreacted Fe2S2 cluster, suggesting that cluster disassembly by NO is rapid and that intermediate nitrosylation products are too unstable to observe. The elemental sulfur that is formed by destruction of the Fe2S2 cluster can further react with the DNIC, resulting in oxidation of the thiolate ligands and formation of the nitrosylated Fe4S3 cluster known as Roussin\u2019s black salt (Chart 1).

With alkyl thiolates such as [(SCH2)2-o-C6H4]2\u2212 (S2-o-xyl2\u2212) oxidation is facile and the thiolate ligands are lost as disulfides resulting in formation of [Fe4S3(NO)7]\u2212. Trapping the elemental sulfur as the phosphine sulfide can obviate this additional reactivity and allow for isolation of alkyl thiolate-bound DNICs. The fate of the sulfide ligands in reactions of biological iron-sulfur clusters with NO remains unknown, although the results with synthetic systems suggest that sulfur byproducts must be sequestered from the vicinity of the iron atoms in order for the DNICs to remain stable. Interestingly, the reverse of cluster nitrosylation has been demonstrated in aerobically growing E. coli cells in the presence of L-cysteine and cysteine desulfurase (IscS). The fact that only sulfur is required for this chemistry is consistent with results using synthetic clusters. Dioxygen may play an important role in these reactions, trapping NO as NO2 or other nitrogen oxides and effectively removing NO. The synthetic cluster, [Fe2S2(S5)2]2\u2212, can be regenerated from the DNIC, [Fe(NO)2(S5)]\u2212, in the presence of S8 and Fe(1,2-benzenedithiolate)2, which serves as a trap for NO. Transformation of the synthetic DNIC, [Fe(NO)2(SEt)2]\u2212, into the corresponding Fe2S2 cluster can also occur via the intermediacy of Roussin\u2019s red salt (Chart 1).

Reaction of Fe4S4 clusters from aconitase, HiPIP, and endonuclease with nitric oxide all lead to formation of protein bound DNICs. As with Fe2S2 clusters, the repair of Fe4S4 clusters by DNICs has been demonstrated in both protein and synthetic systems. Our investigations of the reactivity of several synthetic Fe4S4 clusters with varying equivalents of NO gas or trityl-S-nitrosothiol revealed the thermodynamically stable Roussin\u2019s black salt to be the major product of cluster nitrosylation (Scheme 5). Both the corresponding DNIC and the nitrosylated Fe4S4 clusters, [Fe4S4(NO)4]n\u2212 (n = 1, 2), were also detected in minor quantities by IR spectroscopy. Whether or not these mononitrosyl iron-sulfur clusters represent intermediates in the conversion of [Fe4S4(SR)4]2\u2212 to RBS or result from alternative reaction pathways is not known. In all cases, the corresponding disulfides were isolated as reaction products, indicating that the thiolate ligands were oxidized in the process. These results stand in contrast to work with Fe4S4 cluster proteins, where treatment with NO leads to the formation of protein-bound DNICs. However, when the reaction of NO with the prototypical synthetic cluster [Fe4S4(SPh)4]2\u2212 was carried out in the presence of added PhS\u2212, [Fe(NO)2(SPh)2]\u2212 was detected as the major iron-containing reaction product. These results again suggest that at least two thiolate ligands are required to stabilize DNICs and prevent further reactivity in the presence of elemental sulfur. By comparison, when the sulfide-free Fe4 cluster, [Fe4(SPh)10]2\u2212, was treated with NO, the DNIC and RRE were formed in a 2:1 ratio (eq 3), consistent with the thiolate ligands providing all of the necessary reducing equivalents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 33628, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It therefore appears that in both Fe2S2 and Fe4S4 clusters the sulfide ligands are oxidized during disassembly of the Fe-S core.

RBS is toxic to living cells and without ligand substitution lacks an available site for attachment to proteins. It is therefore unlikely that RBS plays an important role in biological iron-sulfur cluster nitrosylation.

In a biological context, very little work has been devoted to the reactivity of nitric oxide with iron-sulfur clusters containing non-thiolate ligands.

Furthermore, many potentially ligating amino acid residues other than cysteine lack the capacity for redox chemistry and therefore may display different chemistry in reactions with NO. Based on our results with the thiolate- and chloride-bound Fe2S2 clusters, we hypothesized that the chemistry of other Fe2S2 might be expected to follow the same pathway outlined in eq 4. Indeed, we discovered that a synthetic Rieske-type Fe2S2 cluster, [Fe2(\u03bc-S)2(BIPM)(S2-o-xyl)]2\u2212, could be nitrosylated to the corresponding N-bound and S-bound DNICs (Scheme 6).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35553, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Although many examples of DNICs coordinated by nitrogen-donor ligands exist, [Fe(NO)2(BIPM)]\u2212 is the first such complex to be prepared by nitrosylation of an iron-sulfur cluster.

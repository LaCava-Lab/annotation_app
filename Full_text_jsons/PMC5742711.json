In this study, we investigated whether the glial water channel Aquaporin\u20104 (AQP4) is involved in the hypoxia\u2010dependent VEGF upregulation in the retina of a mouse model of oxygen\u2010induced retinopathy (OIR). The expression levels of VEGF, the hypoxia\u2010inducible factor\u20101\u03b1 (HIF\u20101\u03b1) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the production of nitric oxide (NO), the methylation status of the HIF\u20101 binding site (HBS) in the VEGF gene promoter, the binding of HIF\u20101\u03b1 to the HBS, the retinal vascularization and function have been determined in the retina of wild\u2010type (WT) and AQP4 knock out (KO) mice under hypoxic (OIR) or normoxic conditions. In response to 5 days of hypoxia, WT mice were characterized by (i) AQP4 upregulation, (ii) increased levels of VEGF, HIF\u20101\u03b1, iNOS and NO, (iii) pathological angiogenesis as determined by engorged retinal tufts and (iv) dysfunctional electroretinogram (ERG). AQP4 deletion prevents VEGF, iNOS and NO upregulation in response to hypoxia thus leading to reduced retinal damage although in the presence of high levels of HIF\u20101\u03b1. In AQP4 KO mice, HBS demethylation in response to the beginning of hypoxia is lower than in WT mice reducing the binding of HIF\u20101\u03b1 to the VEGF gene promoter. We conclude that in the absence of AQP4, an impaired HBS demethylation prevents HIF\u20101 binding to the VEGF gene promoter and the relative VEGF transactivation, reducing the VEGF\u2010induced retinal damage in response to hypoxia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1812, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 1825, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane water channel proteins allowing water to flow through cell plasma membranes in response to osmotic and hydrostatic gradients 1.

AQP4 has been localized to the M\u00fcller cell end feet, where it facilitates water flux at the glial\u2013vascular interface 3, 4. AQP4 deletion results in a gliotic phenotype 5 although this phenotype does not result in altered retinal responses to light 6. There are several indications that AQP4 is overexpressed in experimental models of retinal diseases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. In some of these models, AQP4 downregulation is generally associated with an amelioration of the pathological signs of the disease 10, 11, 16, although AQP4 silencing has been shown to worsen the pathological signs of diabetic retinopathy 9.

In addition, VEGF administration has been found to induce AQP4 expression, whereas decreasing VEGF results in reduced retinal levels of AQP4 11, 16. There is also evidence of functional interactions between AQP4 and hypoxia\u2010inducible factor\u20101 (HIF\u20101), the major transcription factor regulating VEGF levels in response to hypoxia 19.

In this model, mice are exposed to hyperoxia from postnatal day (PD)7 to PD12 when, after returning to normoxia until PD17, they undergo to relative hypoxia that causes increased activity of HIF\u20101 23. HIF\u20101 is composed of a constitutively expressed \u03b2\u2010subunit (HIF\u20101\u03b2) and an oxygen\u2010regulated \u03b1\u2010subunit (HIF\u20101\u03b1). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF\u20101\u03b1 is stabilized reaching levels that are determined by a balance in positive and negative feedback mechanisms in which NO production plays an important role 24 through increased levels of the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) 24. After HIF\u20101\u03b1 stabilization, HIF\u20101\u03b1 and HIF\u20101\u03b2 translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus where they form a heterodimer that binds to the HBS localized to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter of HIF\u20101 target genes 25. There is indication that in models of ocular neovascular diseases, the induction of VEGF occurs through the HRE in the VEGF gene promoter as HRE deletion prevents the hypoxia\u2010induced VEGF upregulation 26. In addition, it has been reported that hypoxia\u2010induced erythropoietin gene expression is dependent on the methylation status of HBS, when HBS is methylated, its binding with HIF\u20101 is abolished 27. Finally, the methylation of CpG sites in the VEGF gene promoter results in reduced HIF\u20101\u2010driven VEGF expression in the human placenta after preeclampsia and in tongue carcinoma cells in response to hypoxia 28, 29, thus suggesting that something similar might occur in in vivo models of hypoxia\u2010driven neovascular diseases of the retina.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 5869, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In this study, we investigate the role of AQP4 on hypoxia\u2010induced VEGF upregulation with the resulting neovessel growth and ERG dysfunction that characterize the OIR model.

After dark\u2010adaptation overnight, ERG responses were recorded from both eyes together using silver/silver chloride ring electrodes inserted under the lower eyelids, forehead reference electrode, and ground electrode in the tail. Pupils were fully dilated using 0.5% atropine. The cornea was intermittently irrigated with saline solution to maintain the baseline recording. Body temperature was maintained at 38\u00b0C by a heating pad. Mixed (rod and cone) responses were evoked by flashes of different light intensities ranging from \u22123.4 to 1 log cd\u2010s/m2 generated through a Ganzfeld stimulator (Biomedica Mangoni, Pisa, Italy). The electrodes were connected to a two\u2010channel amplifier. Signals were amplified at 1000 gain and bandpass filtered between 0.2 and 500 Hz before being digitized at 5 kHz rate with a data acquisition device (Biomedica Mangoni). The ERG waveforms were examined primarily for amplitude information, and the data (pooled and reported as mean amplitudes \u00b1 S.E.M. in \u03bcV) were graphed to determine any gross changes in the intensity\u2010response function for that eye. Intensity\u2010response functions of the b\u2010wave were fit to a modified Naka\u2010Rushton function 36 V(I) = V0 + (Vmax\u00b7In)/(In + kn). In this equation, V is the amplitude of the b\u2010wave (in \u03bcV), I is the stimulus intensity (in log cd\u2010s/m2), V0 is the non\u2010zero baseline effect, Vmax is the saturated amplitude of the b\u2010wave (in \u03bcV), k is the stimulus intensity that evokes a b\u2010wave of half\u2010maximum amplitude (in log cd\u2010s/m2), n, which was constrained to unity, is a dimensionless constant controlling the slope of the function and represents the degree of heterogeneity of retinal sensitivity. To demonstrate oscillatory potentials (OPs), ERG responses were digitally filtered with bandpass filter between 65 and 300 Hz to eliminate the a\u2010 and b\u2010wave interference and to avoid the 60 Hz line noise. Of the five OPs that can generally be isolated from the mouse ERG, only OP2, OP3 and OP4 were analysed as OP1, and OP5 could not be accurately measured at PD17 37. For each OP, the trough\u2010to\u2010peak amplitude was measured and the amplitudes of each wavelet were added to create the sum OPs (SOPs = OP2 + OP3 + OP4; 38).

Purified bisulphite\u2010treated DNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To search for CpG sites, the promoter of mouse VEGF (GenBank: U41383.1) was analysed by MethPrimer 39. The online available ZymoResearch Software (http://www.zymoresearch.com/tools/bisulfite-primer-seeker) was used to design primers for bisulphite sequencing. Their sequences are shown in Table 1. Fifty nanogram of bisulphite treated and purified DNA was PCR amplified using these primers and High Fidelity Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR products were analysed by 2% agarose gel, and amplicons were eluted by QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced. FinchTV version 1.5.0 (free program from Geospiza, inc.) was used to analyse sequences and to detect double peaks (C/T). All unmethylated cytosines (C) were sequenced as thymine (T) and the presence of a C\u2010peak indicated the presence of 5mC in the genome. The presence of both C\u2010 and T\u2010peaks indicated partial methylation, and the height of C peaks was proportional to methylation frequency. The methylation frequency of the CpG site in the HBS was quantified in retinas at PD12. The Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) of the HBS was performed as reported previously 40. Briefly, 300 ng of PCR products containing the HBS was digested overnight at 37\u00b0C with HPYcH4IV restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA), which is selective for methylated HBS. Restriction fragments were analysed by 2.5% agarose gel, calculating the % of methylated sequences with ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/; provided in the public domain by the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Methylation frequencies of the CpG1 site (inside the HBS) and three CpG sites (CpG2, 3 and 4) proximal to the HBS were measured by the cloning and sequencing approach, performed as follows.

However, HIF\u20101\u03b1 is instead dramatically increased in response to hypoxia in AQP4 KO mice.

As shown here, in the absence of AQP4, neither iNOS expression nor NO production is influenced by hypoxia thus explaining why HIF\u20101\u03b1 stabilization is out of control in the absence of NO overproduction. On the other hand, the lack of NO upregulation may directly cause reduced VEGF levels as NO is known to induce VEGF expression 44. In the OIR model, for instance, inhibition of iNOS has been observed to reduce retinal VEGF 45, 46. Conversely, VEGF may act as an upstream regulator of iNOS 47, thus indicating that reduced VEGF levels may cause reduced iNOS expression in response to hypoxia.

For instance, HBS demethylation is a mandatory process to allow HIF\u20101\u2010dependent erythropoietin gene expression 27. Little is known about the kinetic of CpG demethylation in the HBS and about the kinetic of the interaction with HIF\u20101. Results in human neuroblastoma cells have demonstrated that the HBS in the VEGF promoter is demethylated after 24 hrs of hypoxia and that VEGF mRNA increases at 16 hrs of hypoxia strictly dependent on the enzymes involved in CpG demethylation 50 supporting the hypothesis that during the hypoxic response, a rapid CpG demethylation occurs at the HBS and that there is a tight correlation between hypoxia\u2010induced CpG demethylation and VEGF transactivation. In this respect, recent findings in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells indicate that HIF\u20101\u03b1 binds the HBS within 1 hr of hypoxia, with a peak after 3 hrs 42. This result suggests that CpG demethylation at the HBS level, a mandatory process for HIF\u20101 binding 27, occurs quickly in hypoxic conditions. More generally, there are also indications that the interaction between the VEGF promoter and hypoxia\u2010activated transcription factors occurs rapidly during the hypoxic response. For instance, phosphorylated STAT\u20103 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a transcription factor participating to hypoxia\u2010mediated VEGF transactivation) binds to the VEGF promoter after 30 min. of hypoxia in retinal endothelial cells 51. However, little is known about these mechanisms in the hypoxic retina. There is evidence that HIF\u20101\u03b1 is regulated over time after the beginning of hypoxia with a peak of stabilization occurring at 2 hrs 23. In addition, VEGF mRNA is constitutively expressed in the inner nuclear layer where it drastically increases 6 hrs after the onset of hypoxia and remains elevated for several days 23. This is also confirmed here by the demonstration that maximal accumulation of VEGF mRNA takes places between 6 and 12 hrs of hypoxia. As also shown by the present results, 1 hr of hypoxia induces HBS demethylation at the level of the VEGF promoter in line with the time course of retinal accumulation of HIF\u20101\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA reported during the hypoxic response 23. The additional evidence from the present results that AQP4 deletion drastically reduces VEGF expression already after 12 hrs of hypoxia is indicative of the fact that mechanisms of VEGF transactivation might be influenced by AQP4 absence already after the first hours of hypoxia. In this line, we found that AQP4 deletion prevents the HBS demethylation process. To provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that the observed change in the HBS methylation status may affect HIF\u20101 accessibility to the VEGF promoter, therefore influencing retinal levels of VEGF, we checked the physical interaction between HIF\u20101\u03b1 and the HBS in the VEGF promoter. We show here for the first time in hypoxic retina that a physical interaction between HIF\u20101\u03b1 and the HBS occurs in the first hours of hypoxia and that this interaction is strongly affected by AQP4. The schematic diagram in Figure 8 shows the hypothetical sequence of events in normoxia and hypoxia in WT and AQP4 KO mice. We suggest that the absence of AQP4 reduces HBS demethylation limiting the accessibility of HIF\u20101 to the VEGF gene promoter therefore reducing VEGF transcription and accumulation in response to hypoxia.

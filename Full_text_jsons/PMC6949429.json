Neither a vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy exists to control RSV or HMPV infections. During viral genome replication and transcription, the tetrameric phosphoprotein P serves as a crucial adaptor between the nucleoprotein-RNA (N-RNA) template and the L protein, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) and cap-specific methyltransferases (MTases) activities. How P interacts with L and mediates association with the free form of N and with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is not clear for HMPV or other prominent human pathogens including measles, Ebola and rabies viruses. Here, we report a cryo-EM reconstruction showing the ring-shaped structure of the polymerase and capping domains of HMPV L, bound with a tetramer of P. The connector and MTase domains are mobile with respect to the core. The putative priming loop important for initiation of RNA synthesis is fully retracted, leaving space in the active-site cavity for RNA elongation. P interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L, burying more than 4,016 \u00c52 of molecular surface area in the interface. Two of the four helices forming the coiled-coil tetramerization domain of P, and long C-terminal extensions projecting from these two helices, wrap around the L protein like tentacles. The structural versatility of the four P protomers, which are largely disordered in their free state, demonstrates an example of a \u201cfolding-upon-partner-binding\u201d mechanism for carrying-out P adaptor functions.

A feature shared by RdRps that do not need a polynucleotide primer to initiate polymerization, is a \u201cpriming loop\u201d (Fig. 2c, d) that supports the initiating rNTP. In the influenza polymerase, a proline at the tip of a \u03b2-hairpin of PB1 plays a key role for replication initiation. In rhabdoviruses (VSV and rabies virus), the corresponding loop is in the capping domain and contains residues important both for terminal de novo initiation and for mRNA capping, with a Trp residue in the capping domain essential for de novo initiation, indicating it is the priming residue. In sequence alignments, a Tyr residue lies at a similar position in HMPV-L (Tyr1201) and RSV-L (Tyr1276), which could provide base-stacking interactions required for priming (Supplementary Fig. 2). We tested this possibility using the RSV polymerase, which initiates at positions 1 and 3 on its promoter. A Tyr1276Ala substitution did not hamper RSV initiation from either site, but Ala substitution of either Pro1261 or Trp1262, corresponding to Pro1186 and Trp1187 in HMPV-L in motif B\u2019 of the capping domain (Fig. 2c), inhibited an early stage of RNA synthesis within the promoter region (Fig. 2e, f), suggesting that either this Pro or Trp residue might be responsible for priming de novo RNA synthesis.

Much of P appears to fold upon binding to L, as shown by the presence of several extended arms typical of large molecular assemblies such as ribosomes or viral particles (Fig. 1, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Video 2). A large molecular surface area (Extended Data Fig. 4) becomes buried in the interaction, mostly involving residues from P1 and P2, while P3 and P4 provide few interactions (Fig. 4a). Previous structural studies mapped the tetramerization and L-binding regions of P to the four parallel \u03b1-helices (spanning residues 171\u2013193 of P) that could be visualized using X-ray crystallography. In contrast, the N-terminal M2\u20131 binding regions of P, and the C-terminal regions of P that bind to the RNP were found to be \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d in the absence of their respective binding partners. While the tetramerization region of P appears as a rigid unit largely unaltered upon binding L, a disorder-to-order transition in the C-terminal regions of the two subunits proximal to L takes place upon binding: residues 194 to 213 of P1 fold into a \u03b2-hairpin, such that a three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet is formed with residues 383\u2013391 of the fingers subdomain of L (Fig. 4c). This \u03b2-hairpin is followed by a long tentacle-like structure composed of three consecutive \u03b1-helices that encircle the rear aperture, through which rNTPs gain access to the active site chamber (Fig. 3a). Residues at the C-terminus of the adjacent coiled-coil-forming helix (from P2) project in the opposite direction towards the capping domain (Fig. 4d) with residues 199\u2013205 and 207\u2013213 making two short \u03b1-helices and 215\u2013236 forming an extended helical arm (Fig. 4a, d).

P acts as a chaperone by preventing non-specific aggregation of the N protein in the presence of non-viral RNA, preserving a pool of monomeric RNA-free N protein (N0) for RNP assembly. The P-N0 interaction involves an \u03b1-helix from HMPV-P (residues 12\u201328) that inserts into a hydrophobic groove in the CTD of the N0 protein. Here the entire regions N-terminal to the coiled coil of the four P subunits, including the N-terminal \u03b1-helix (PNTD), are disordered. The tetrameric coiled-coil appears to be anchored to the L protein at a location such that these helices, at the tips of flexible polar linkers spanning residues 29\u2013135, can bind and deliver N0 to the RNA exit tunnel for encapsidating nascent RNA (Fig. 4e). The amino-acid sequence 29\u2013135 of P (Extended Data Fig. 9) bears physico-chemical properties expected of a linker that evolved to ensure the spatial search of nascent RNA exiting L, by N0 bound to PNTD. In the present structure, the C-terminal regions of P are in non-equivalent positions (Fig. 1f, g). These segments have been proposed to dislodge RNA from the RNP complex and feed it into the template tunnel (Fig. 4e). Their structural asymmetry probably reflects different roles for the C-terminal domains of each subunit: while the C-terminal end of subunit P2 approaches the RNA template entry tunnel (Fig. 3c) and is well placed to bind N-RNA, the corresponding end of P1 is too distant to play a similar role (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the N-terminus of L (residues 8\u201324) wraps around the template entry tunnel (Fig. 3c). Thus, in addition to the C-terminal helix of P2, the NTD of L could help displace N to allow naked RNA to feed into the template tunnel (Fig. 3c). In summary, the tetrameric phosphoprotein binds to the monomeric L and fulfills its various adaptor functions by adopting an asymmetric structure (Fig. 4e) through (i) \u201cconformational switching\u201d, whereby each of the four P subunits folds into a different structure, depending on its position in the molecular assembly (ii) spatially confining structurally important N- and C-terminal helical elements (PNTD and PCTD) to the free and RNA-bound N protein respectively, through long flexible regions tethered to the rigidly anchored coiled-coil (Fig. 4e).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"bioctype": "BioCPassage", "offset": 13597, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While this manuscript was under revision, the structure of RSV L:P was reported.

Moreover, the putative RSV-L priming loop retracts to a similar position as seen here for HMPV-L. In RSV, hydrophobic residues critical for L: P interactions (L216, L223 and L227 of RSV-P) have been shown to be critical for polymerase function. The corresponding region, residues 251\u2013265, of subunit P1 of the HMPV phosphoprotein contains several residues that contact L (Fig. 4c). The overall conservation of interactions between L and P within the family Pneumoviridae, suggests the possibility of broad-spectrum inhibitors disrupting the L: P interface. We note that dimeric P proteins from rabies virus that interact with the C-terminal region of L clearly differ from tetrameric P proteins as for HMPV, that bind to the N-terminal part of L.

We performed one round of mode 3 alignment for the 2D class images against the 3D initial model in frealign (version 9.11), with CTF correction turned off. We then calculated projection matching using frealign (version 9.11) to cross-validate the 3D model and to confirm the 2D class selection as a self-consistency test. We performed 3D classification straightly with 6 classes in Relion until convergence (within 50 iterations). Two classes were clearly of high quality and superimposed well, with a cross correlation coefficient higher than 99%. We combined these two classes, yielding a total of 437,611 particles. The handedness of the maps was confirmed to be correct as judged by well-defined \u03b1-helices. From this point on, we scaled the alignment parameters to 1.24 \u00c5/pixel and used the full resolution data for further analysis. Relion auto-refinement of these particles produced a map of 4.0-\u00c5 resolution. We further improved the resolution to 3.9-\u00c5 after refining the per-particle motion in Relion and to 3.8 \u00c5 after beam tilt refinement by treating all particles as one group. Refining the defocus of individual particles did not yield obvious improvement. We confirmed convergence of motion correction by another round of per-particle motion refinement, which yielded no apparent improvement. Nonetheless, the quality of this map at 3.8-\u00c5 resolution was excellent, as judged by main-chain continuity and side-chain densities (Extended data Fig. 1g, h). We further classified the 437,611 particles into six classes and discarded four junk classes, yielding a total of 302,346 particles. We auto-refined the two good classes individually or combined and again they overlapped nearly perfectly. We then gave the data more weights by adjusting the T number in Relion and later performed masked alignment, while correcting FSC for effects of the solvent mask. We visually examined the results and found out that a T number of 4 produced the best map without apparent signs of over-fitting. This combined with another round of per-particle motion refinement, beam tilt refinement, and per particle defocus refinement eventually yielded a map at 3.7 \u00c5. In an effort to improve the density associated with P, we generated masks for P and L using Chimera segger and performed multi-body refinement using Relion, with the orientation of P relative to L fixed. We also subtracted the L signal from the 2D images, excised P from the 2D images, and performed 3D classification without alignment. Neither approach improved the P density, perhaps due to insufficient signal considering the small size of P.

First, we fitted the RdRp and capping enzymatic domains of the VSV-L model (PDB access code: 5A22) into the map as well as the coiled-coil domain of P (PDB access code: 4BXT) and then used these as a guide for finding main-chain connectivity. Local resolution analysis indicated that the majority of the core portion of the complex falls within a resolution range of 3.0\u20133.6 \u00c5, with excellent main-chain connectivity and side chain densities throughout the molecules (Extended Data Fig 1g, h). The majority of the electron density showed excellent continuity giving confidence for tracing the \u03b1\u2013carbon chain. Moreover, in most regions, clear electron density for side chains allowed us to unambiguously assign the sequence register. We only observed weak and disordered extra density accounting for a portion of the CD and CRVI+ domains in maps sharpened with lower B factors and/or low-pass filtered with lower spatial frequency, suggesting that these domains are highly flexible in the complexes we examined. The appendage of HMPV-L might become fixed with respect to the ring-shaped core domain upon binding to a peptide encompassing residues 35\u2013106 of the VSV-P used in the VSV-L study. Indeed, a recent study of the rabies virus L protein in complex with the counterpart of this P peptide demonstrates such contacts between P and L (Josh Horwitz and Stephen C. Harrison, personal communication). Although there were some stretches of weaker densities for the P protein, long side-chains of arginine and lysine residues ensured the correct polarity and register assignment of the sequence. We further confirmed that the sequence was in register by comparing the model with the coiled-coil interface of the known structure of the phosphoprotein tetramerization region (PDB code: 4BXT). Overall, we traced the entire NTD subdomain and RdRp domain spanning residues 8\u2013892, except for mobile residues 1\u20137 (predicted to be disordered using the PrDOS prediction server http://prdos.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/top.cgi), 607\u2013625 (603\u2013625 are predicted to be disordered), the complete capping enzyme domain (residues 893\u20131380) and the four P subunits (residues 169\u2013266, 171\u2013236, 168\u2013219, and 169\u2013193/204\u2013231 of subunits P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively). Residues 194\u2013203 of subunit P4 are disordered. While the sequences could be assigned unambiguously for P1 and P2 residues as well as for the coiled coil region of P3 and P4, the sequence assignment for the C-terminal ends of P3 and P4 that are predicted to form helices is less certain. These segments might become fully ordered only in the presence of the ribonucleoprotein (see main text). Model building was interspersed with refinement using the real space refinement option in the package PHENIX (rigid_body, minimization_global, local grid searching and ADP) for the coordinates and B factors. We applied Ramachandran, rotamer and secondary structure restraints throughout the refinement, in addition to the standard geometry and B factor restraints. Over 40 rounds of manual rebuilding and phenix real space refinement were carried out until we had high confidence of the sequence register, density fitting, model geometry and local chemical environments.

Proteins were purified by metal affinity, TEV cleavage of Histidine-tag followed by reverse His-tag affinity purification and size exclusion chromatography. b, Analysis of the 3\u2032 extension activity of HMPV polymerase using the le25 RNA template. Reactions were performed with rNTPs (0.5 mM each of rUTP, rGTP and rCTP), 20 \u03bcM rATP and 20 nM [\u03b1-32P] rATP. When a 3\u2019-modified le25 (le25[SpC3], three-carbon spacer group linked to the 3\u2019 extremity) was used as a template, synthesis of products greater than 25 nt was greatly reduced compared to le25. When only [\u03b1-32P]rATP and no other rNTP was supplied, only a product with size greater than 25 nt was observed. This result shows that the L:P complex was capable of modifying the 3\u2019 terminus of the template, in addition to engaging in de novo initiation at the promoter.

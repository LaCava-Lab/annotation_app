TF-FVIIa triggers cell signaling events by cleavage of protease activated receptor (PAR2) at the Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond. The recognition of PAR2 by the FVIIa protease domain is poorly understood. We perform molecular modeling and dynamics simulations to derive the PAR2-FVIIa interactions. Docking of the PAR2 Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond to the S1 site and subsequent molecular dynamics leads to interactions of the PAR2 ectodomain with P and P\u2019 sites of the FVIIa catalytic cleft as well as to electrostatic interactions between a stably folded region of PAR2 and a cluster of basic residues remote from the catalytic cleft of FVIIa. To address the functional significance of this interaction for PAR2 cleavage, we employed two antibodies with epitopes previously mapped to this cluster of basic residues. Although these antibodies do not block the catalytic cleft, both antibodies completely abrogated PAR2 activation by TF-FVIIa. Our simulations indicate a conformation of the PAR2 ectodomain that limits the cleavage site to no more than 33 A from its membrane proximal residue. Since the active site of FVIIa in the TF-FVIIa complex is ~ 75A above the membrane, cleavage of the folded conformation of PAR2 would require tilting of the TF-FVIIa complex toward the membrane, indicating that additional cellular factors may be required to properly align the scissile bond of PAR2 with TF-FVIIa.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1623, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1636, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane-bound cell-surface protein and the primary initiator in the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade (reviewed in References).

FVIIa\u2019s His57 should have a hydrogen on the delta nitrogen (ND1) but not on the epsilon nitrogen (NE2), thus it is named as Hid57 (AMBER nomenclature). At the beginning (Left), His57:ND1 donates two hydrogen bonds to Asp102:OD1 & OD2 and His57:NE2 accepts a hydrogen bond from PAR2\u2019s Ser37:N. The side-chain oxygen of Ser37 (OG) forms a hydrogen bond with both of the nitrogens of FVIIa\u2019s His57. These two hydrogen bonds are apparently not required for cleavage by a serine protease and thus may have been artificially created in building the starting structure. They are eventually lost during molecular dynamics. The right-hand panel of Figure 1 shows the catalytic site averaged over the last 18 ns of the 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation. In the last 43 ns, there were no positional restraints on the FVIIa catalytic site or PAR2\u2019s Arg36-Ser37.

The implicit solvent molecular dynamics is stopped before other parts of the PAR2 bind to FVIIa. This allows water molecules to be added between PAR2 and FVIIa in order to simulate their binding in a fully solvated environment. The RMSDs of the FVIIa protease domain and PAR2 ectodomain as a function of simulation time in explicit solvent are shown in Figure 3. The four vertical lines mark the four parameter-changing events in the simulation (see METHODS). The FVIIa RMSD increases to 0.8 A during equilibration but only slightly increases after that. It is not affected by either Event 1 or 2, has a slight drop and then increase again after Event 3 (the crystal Cl\u2212 ion is released from the PAR2-FVIIa interface at 19 ns), and is mostly stable after Event 4 (increase of temperature to 310 K at 33 ns). The PAR2 RMSD fluctuations are expectedly much larger. It basically fluctuates between 5 and 9 A during 0\u201315 ns, fluctuations are smaller after Event #2 (the atomic charges of the Gly71 carboxyl group are changed to zeros), becomes stable after Event #3, and fluctuates between 8 and 12 A after Event #4. Thus, at physiological temperature the PAR2 ectodomain is more dynamic than it is at room temperature. Visualizing the trajectory we see that the most of the flexibility in the PAR2 ectodomain occurs before Arg31 and after Glu56, accounting for the fluctuation of the PAR2 RMSD (see also Supporting Information S2). We also note the stability of folded regions of the ectodomain that are distal from the cleavage site (see Figure 8).

PAR2 is shown as secondary structure representation in orange. The PAR2 residues Arg31-Asp43, Val53, and Glu56 are shown in ball-and-stick with Arg36 and Ile39 in a thicker model. Labeled residues include (1) all residues involving inter-molecular electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds except those FVIIa residues that interact with PAR2 Arg36 and Ser37 (see their positions in Figure 1); (2) the key residues that form the binding pocket for PAR2; (3) the FVIIa residues that form a mini binding pocket for PAR2\u2019s Ile39. The labels on FVIIa residues are in either black or white and use the one-letter residue code. The labels on the PAR2 residues are orange and have use the 3 letter code.

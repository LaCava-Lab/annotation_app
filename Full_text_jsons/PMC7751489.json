The aim of the present study was to investigate the biomolecular role and underlying mechanism of CBX2 in the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells. Short hairpin RNA-CBX2 and yes-associated protein (YAP) overexpression plasmids were constructed to regulate CBX2 and YAP expression, respectively. Additionally, the expression of certain mRNAs and proteins involved in the YAP/\u03b2-catenin pathway and those associated with cell invasion were assessed by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, respectively. The cellular behaviors of MFC cells were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation wound-healing and Transwell assays. The results of the present study revealed that increased CBX2 expression was observed in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric cells. In addition, CBX2 knockdown inhibited the nuclear cytoplasm translocation of YAP, inducing its phosphorylation, and suppressing the activation of the \u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. The results also demonstrated that CBX2 depletion inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells by inactivating the YAP/\u03b2-catenin pathway.

It is estimated that >1,000,000 new cases of GC were diagnosed (5.7% of the overall cancer incidence) and 800,000 deaths occurred (8.2% of all cancer mortalities) in 2018 worldwide. Furthermore, according to previous studies, patients with GC regularly exhibit partial metastasis at diagnosis or during chemotherapy. Despite advances in GC diagnostic techniques, surgery and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the 5-year survival rate remains poor in China, particularly at advanced stages. Owing to the complexity of the pathogenesis of GC, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. CBX2 is widely considered to be a tumor-promoting gene. Due to its significant association with large tumor size and lymph node metastasis, it has been reported that CBX2 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Additionally, CBX2 has been demonstrated to be upregulated in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which was closely associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, high CBX2 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma, with CBX2 serving regulatory effects on proliferation and apoptosis via the phosphorylation of yes-associated protein (YAP) in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

The present study revealed that CBX2 knockdown inhibited nuclear localization and \u03b2-catenin accumulation, and suppressed the expression of its downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1, suggesting that CBX2 promoted tumorigenesis and progression in GC via the \u03b2-catenin pathway. To confirm whether the \u03b2-catenin pathway was involved in the role of CBX2 in GC, the expression of DKK1, which is a negative regulator of \u03b2-catenin signaling, was silenced. DKK1 knockdown inhibited the suppressive effect of CBX2 knockdown on GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that CBX2 promoted GC cell proliferation and metastasis by activating the \u03b2-catenin pathway.

P-YAP binds to other proteins and cannot translocate into the cell nucleus, and is subsequently degraded by ubiquitination in the cytoplasm, thereby leading to the inactivation of YAP. According to a previous study, YAP served a crucial role in organ growth and cell proliferation. Furthermore, YAP was reported to contribute to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Tang et al demonstrated that the expression of \u03b2-catenin was markedly reduced after YAP downregulation in laryngeal cancer cells. Wang et al also reported that P-YAP contributed to the degradation of \u03b2-catenin in colorectal cancer cells. Thus, YAP may represent an effective target in anticancer therapy. In the present study, YAP overexpression plasmids were transfected into GC cells to induce YAP upregulation. The results demonstrated that CBX2 knockdown elevated P-YAP levels and inhibited YAP expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that CBX2 knockdown promoted YAP translocation, causing the degradation of cytoplasmic YAP. In addition, YAP inhibition suppressed the expression of \u03b2-catenin and its downstream signaling molecules, including c-myc and cyclin D1, which is consistent with the results of the present study. The current study revealed that YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of CBX2 knockdown on the \u03b2-catenin pathway. The results indicated that CBX2 regulated the GC cell cycle, migration and invasion via the YAP/\u03b2-catenin pathway. The present study provided evidence to support that CBX2 may be an effective target for GC treatment. However, the present study had several limitations.

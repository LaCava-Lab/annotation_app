30,PMC10546312,TITLE,front,Optimization of universal allogeneic CAR-T cells combining CRISPR and transposon-based technologies for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
31,PMC10546312,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Despite the potential of CAR-T therapies for hematological malignancies, their efficacy in patients with relapse and refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia has been limited. The aim of our study has been to develop and manufacture a CAR-T cell product that addresses some of the current limitations. We initially compared the phenotype of T cells from AML patients and healthy young and elderly controls. This analysis showed that T cells from AML patients displayed a predominantly effector phenotype, with increased expression of activation (CD69 and HLA-DR) and exhaustion markers (PD1 and LAG3), in contrast to the enriched memory phenotype observed in healthy donors. This differentiated and more exhausted phenotype was also observed, and corroborated by transcriptomic analyses, in CAR-T cells from AML patients engineered with an optimized CAR construct targeting CD33, resulting in a decreased in vivo antitumoral efficacy evaluated in xenograft AML models. To overcome some of these limitations we have combined CRISPR-based genome editing technologies with virus-free gene-transfer strategies using Sleeping Beauty transposons, to generate CAR-T cells depleted of HLA-I and TCR complexes (HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells) for allogeneic approaches. Our optimized protocol allows one-step generation of edited CAR-T cells that show a similar phenotypic profile to non-edited CAR-T cells, with equivalent in vitro and in vivo antitumoral efficacy. Moreover, genomic analysis of edited CAR-T cells revealed a safe integration profile of the vector, with no preferences for specific genomic regions, with highly specific editing of the HLA-I and TCR, without significant off-target sites. Finally, the production of edited CAR-T cells at a larger scale allowed the generation and selection of enough HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells that would be compatible with clinical applications. In summary, our results demonstrate that CAR-T cells from AML patients, although functional, present phenotypic and functional features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors. The combination of CRISPR technologies with transposon-based delivery strategies allows the generation of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells, compatible with allogeneic approaches, that would represent a promising option for AML treatment."
32,PMC10546312,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
33,PMC10546312,INTRO,paragraph,"Adoptive immunotherapy using T cells engineered with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CAR-T cells) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for several B cell malignancies. The impressive results with CAR-T cells targeting CD19 and BCMA have led to the approval by the FDA and the EMA of several CAR-T cell products for refractory cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B cell lymphoma. Nevertheless, the use of CAR-T cell therapy for other hematological malignancies, and in particular for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), still presents specific challenges that hamper their efficacy and limit their implementation. One of the main biological barriers for CAR-T therapies in AML is the absence of AML-specific antigens. Most of the cell surface antigens present in AML blasts (CD33, CD123, or CLL1) are also present in normal hematopoietic, representing a safety concern, since a prolonged myeloablation would be ultimately fatal. Thus, several strategies to prevent the risk of bone marrow failure after CAR-T therapy have been proposed, including the limitation of CAR-T cell persistence, by the inclusion of safety switches, or the identification of neoantigens specific for AML blasts. Another interesting approach, currently under clinical evaluation, is the generation of leukemia-specific antigen by deleting CD33 from normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, thereby enabling specific targeting of AML with CD33-CAR-T cells, since hematopoietic system would be resistant to CD33-targeted therapy. Nevertheless, most of the current CAR-T therapies under clinical evaluation are directed against CD33 or CD123, reporting antitumoral responses in some cases, although more complete clinical results have yet to be published. In addition, the dependency on patient-specific T cells for autologous approaches, particularly from heavily treated patients, may lead to inadequate T cell numbers, suboptimal CAR-T cell functions, and unsuccessful CAR-T cell production. However, there is a lack of studies performing a detailed and deep characterization of AML patient-derived CAR-T cells with a direct comparison to CAR-T cells from healthy donors."
34,PMC10546312,INTRO,paragraph,"The use of allogeneic CAR-T cells could overcome some of the limitations of autologous patient-specific CAR-T cells. However, allogeneic cells may trigger graft-versus- host disease (GvHD) that would compromise therapeutic safety. Since TCR ablation prevents GvHD, several strategies for endogenous TCR inactivation in CAR-T cells have been reported. One of the most promising approaches relies on the use of TALEN and/or CRISPR technologies for TCR disruption, which can be combined with different viral and non-viral vectors for the generation of allogeneic CAR-T cells. Despite allogeneic CAR-T cells can be successfully manufactured for therapeutic applications, there is an unmet need to overcome several limitations related to complex manufacturing procedures or the use of viral vectors, that would allow a cost-effective and safer generation of allogeneic CAR-T cell products. In this sense, the use of non-viral vectors based on Sleeping Beauty transposon systems for CAR delivery has emerged as a promising option that offers a number of advantages, including larger cargo capacity, reduced manufacturing complexity and costs, and safer integration profiles compared with integrating viral vectors. Nevertheless, the combination of Sleeping Beauty transposon systems with CRISPR technologies for the manufacturing of allogeneic CAR-T cells has not been extensively explored."
35,PMC10546312,INTRO,paragraph,"In this work, we have performed a deep phenotypic, transcriptomic, and functional characterization of T and CAR-T cells from AML patients that resulted in the identification of specific features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors. To overcome some of these limitations we have combined CRISPR-based genome editing technologies with virus-free gene-transfer strategies using Sleeping Beauty transposons, to generate allogeneic CAR-T cells targeting CD33. Our optimized protocol allows the generation of fully functional HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T cells in conditions compatible with clinical applications. These allogeneic CD33-CAR-T cells would represent a promising option for AML treatment, especially for therapeutic approaches in R/R AML patients where CAR-T cells are used to reduce tumor burden as bridging therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation."

Stem cell memory, T cell activation, and exhaustion gene signatures used in this work were obtained from previous publications ( Table S2 ). The normalized gene expression matrix was used to discover the disrupted genes after stimulation of AML CAR-T cells in comparison to adult and senior CAR-T cells. These genes were found using the maSigPro package (version 1.72.0) which applies a negative binomial model to the expression distribution and adjusts the false discovery rate using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure. The degree of polynomial regression in this study was set to 2, and the two ways forward elimination algorithm was used to perform stepwise regression to select genes with alpha equal to 0.05.

70,PMC10546312,RESULTS,title_2,Design and selection of an optimized CAR targeting CD33
71,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"A panel of 12 different 4-1BB second-generation CAR constructs targeting CD33, derived from 2 different monoclonal antibodies (scFv from my96 and M195) and presenting hinge regions with different lengths from CD8a or IgG4 molecules were generated ( Figure S1A ). CAR design also included a truncated version of the human EGFR (hEGFRt) as a reporter gene to facilitate tracking of the CAR-T cells. The specific activation of the main signaling pathways (NFAT, NFkB, and AP1) after tumor recognition was measured using a triple reporter system in Jurkat cells (Jurkat-TPR). After transduction with lentiviral particles coding for the different CAR constructs Jurkat-TPR was cocultured with MOLM-13 cells, an AML cell line expressing CD33 established from the peripheral blood of an acute monocytic leukemia relapsed patient. Non-transduced cells (UTD) or transduced with a CAR targeting CD19 were used as controls. The top three CAR constructs [my96(45aa), my96(228aa), and M195(45aa)] showing the highest specificity without tonic signal were selected for further in vitro and in vivo functional analysis ( Figure S1B ). CAR-T cells with the selected CAR constructs were generated from healthy donors and functionally characterized. Transduction efficiency (CAR+ cells) and expansion capacity of CAR-T cells were similar between the three selected constructs. Evaluation of their in vitro lytic activity by regular cytotoxic assay against MOLM-13 cells showed that all three CAR-T cells effectively killed tumor cells at low E:T ratios. The in vivo antitumoral efficacy was evaluated in a xenograft model in NSG mice by administration of 3x106 CAR-T cells/animal 4 days after intravenous administration of 5x104 cells/animal MOLM-13 cells expressing luciferase. CAR-T cells derived from my96 antibody presented a statistically significant increased antitumor efficacy in vivo compared to M195(45) CAR-T cells. Finally, the my96(45) CAR, containing the 45aa hinge from CD8a, was selected for the rest of the studies ( Figures S1C–F )."
72,PMC10546312,RESULTS,title_2,CAR-T cells from AML patients are associated with decreased in vitro and in vivo functionality
73,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"Since AML is associated with the presence of abnormal T cells phenotypes, we performed a phenotypic characterization of T cells collected from a cohort of 21 AML patients ( Table S5 ). When compared to T cells from young adults (below 30) or aged-matched healthy donors (senior), T cells from AML patients presented a more differentiated phenotype, particularly in the CD8+ compartment, with significant enrichment of effector (TE) cells. In contrast, T cells from healthy donors were enriched in naïve T cells (TN) ( Figures 1A, B ,  S2 ). Moreover, T cells from AML patients also displayed significantly higher expression of activation (CD69, HLA-DR) and exhaustion (PD1, LAG3) markers compared to healthy donors ( Figures 1C ,  S2 ). To determine whether differences in phenotype and activation may play a role in the functionality of CAR-T cells, using our selected CAR construct, we generated CAR-T cells (CD33-CAR-T) from AML patients that were compared to CD33-CAR-T cells from young (adult) and elderly (senior) healthy donors ( Table S5 ). Non-transduced T cells (UTD) from each group were used as controls. The proliferation capacity of the CD33-CAR-T and UTD cells from the different groups was similar, reaching 4-5 population doublings during the expansion phase. Moreover, similar transduction efficiency was observed between the different groups, with around 50% of CAR+ cells, suggesting that transduction was not impaired in AML T cells ( Figures 2A, B ). Phenotypic analysis revealed that CD33-CAR-T cells from both senior donors and AML patients presented a statistically significant reduced percentage of memory stem (TSCM) and central memory T cells (TCM), with increased levels of activation markers like CD69 and HLA-DR. However, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented an increased proportion of terminal effector (TE) T cells, with higher levels of PD1 and LAG3 exhaustion markers ( Figures 2C, D ,  S3 ). Altogether, these data suggest that the initial T cell phenotype has a clear impact on the final phenotypic features of the CAR-T cells, with significant differences in the differentiation, activation, and exhaustion states produced by both age-related and AML-specific factors."

76,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we decided to analyze the in vitro and in vivo functional capacity of the generated CAR-T cells. Regardless of their origin, all CD33-CAR-T cells were highly cytotoxic, producing similar levels of IFN-γ ( Figures 3A, B ,  S4 ). To further explore CAR-T cell functionality under more challenging conditions, a continuous repeated in vitro stimulation for 21 days with tumoral cells was performed. Under these conditions, we found that CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients presented a more exhausted phenotype, with increased PD1 and LAG3 expression, and a decreased proliferation potential that was statistically significant ( Figures 3C, D ,  S4 ). These features were also associated with reduced cytotoxic capacity after repeated restimulations ( Figure 3E ). The antitumoral potential of the CAR-T cells was then evaluated in vivo in a xenograft model of NSG mice transplanted with MOLM-13 cells, as described above. Treatment with all CD33-CAR-T cells significantly increased animal survival compared to UTD controls with no differences between male and female animals ( Figure S4 ). Interestingly, CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients showed a statistically significant reduction of the antitumor activity with reduced survival compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors (adult and senior) ( Figure 3F ). To address whether the decreased capacity of CD33-CAR-T from AML patients could be reverted by modifying the design on the CAR construct, we replaced 4-1BB sequence by CD28 costimulatory domain and compared CD33-CAR-T cells generated from AML patients using both constructs. Similar transduction efficiency and proliferation potential were observed between 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells, with no differences in the phenotypic subpopulations, activation/exhaustion markers, cytotoxic capacity, or IFN-γ production after coculture with tumoral cells ( Figure S5 ). Finally, both 4-1BB and CD28 CAR-T cells presented similar antitumoral efficacy in vivo in the xenograft model in NSG mice ( Figure S5 ). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the CD28 costimulatory domain does not improve the functionality of CAR-T cells from AML patients."

79,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"Given the phenotypic and functional differences observed between CAR-T cells from AML patients and healthy donors, we further analyze CD4+ and CD8+ CD33-CAR-T cells at the transcriptomic level. RNAseq analysis before antigen recognition revealed that CAR-T cells from AML patients were transcriptionally similar to those from senior healthy donors, with only a few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an FDR<0.05 and a |log2FC|>1 (31 for CD4+ and 12 for CD8+ CAR-T cells) ( Table S6 ). In contrast, most of the differences were observed when CAR-T cells from senior healthy donors and AML patients were compared to CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors (752 and 853 DEGs in CD4+ and 807 and 705 in CD8+ CAR-T cells respectively) ( Figure S6A ). All these differences were reflected in a principal components analysis where CAR-T cells from AML patients clustered together and close to those from senior healthy donors, being separated from CAR-T cells from adult healthy donors in both CD4+ and CD8+ CAR-T cell subsets ( Figure 4A ). A closer analysis of the DEGs revealed that most of the differences observed with adult CAR-T cells were shared between senior and AML CAR-T cells, clearly indicating age-related differences. Thus, CAR-T cells from AML patients and senior healthy donors were enriched in genes related to activation, such as CIITA, with downregulation of genes associated with stem cell memory, like CD28 ( Figure 4B ,  S6D ). Moreover, gene ontology (GO) analysis of common DEGs showed enrichment in pathways related to the regulation of lymphocyte and T cell differentiation ( Figure S6C ), which would explain the more differentiated phenotype observed in the subpopulation analysis. Interestingly, we observed that about 30-40% of the DEGs between AML and adult CAR-T cells were unique to AML condition, indicating specific differences intrinsic to AML. We observed increased expression of genes related to lymphocyte exhaustion, such as LAG3 and NR4A1. Moreover, important genes related to T cell memory (BATF3, CCR7), T cell differentiation (GATA3), apoptosis (BAX, BCL family), or IFN response (OAS1) were also deregulated ( Figure 4C ,  S6E ). In accordance, GO analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to lymphocyte activation, response to stress and DNA damage, regulation of the immune response, antigen receptor-mediated signaling, and regulation of the cell cycle ( Figure S6C ). We further characterized CAR-T cells from AML patients upon stimulation with tumoral cells. Two weeks after stimulation we observed a set of genes presenting disrupted expression patterns (different behavior after stimulation) compared to adult and senior CAR-T cells ( Figures 4D ,  S6F ). Those genes were related to CAR-T cell migration and cell adhesion (CD81, CCL5, MMP25), proliferation (IRF1, CCR7), or regulation of cytokine production (KLF2, IL32), which would explain the reduced proliferation potential and antitumoral efficacy of these AML CAR-T cells. Altogether, these data suggest that CAR-T cells from AML patients present dysfunctional features already identified in the initial T cells, exacerbated after tumor recognition that may compromise the long-term antitumoral efficacy."

82,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"Due to the reduced potential of the CD33-CAR-T cells from AML patients and, in no less measure, the fact that delaying treatment in patients with AML may be unacceptable, we decided to approach these issues by generating allogeneic CD33-CAR-T cells. To prevent the immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) associated with allogeneic cells, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout HLA-I and TCR expression. First, we designed different single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) targeting exon 1 of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and exon 1 of T-cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus, and we selected three sgRNAs based on their location and the predicted on-target/off-target efficiency ( Table S3 ). Cleavage efficiency was evaluated in vitro by TIDE after transfection of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) and sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) in the Jurkat cell line. β2M-sgRNA3 and TRAC-sgRNA2 were selected for further studies since they presented the highest cleavage efficacy, inducing frameshift mutations (mostly 1nt insertions) that resulted in the reduction of HLA-I and TCR levels ( Figure S7 ). Then, selected CRISPR RNPs were combined with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system to generate HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T (CAR-TKO) cells from healthy donors. The transposon vector containing the selected CD33 targeting CAR construct was used as minicircle (MC) and the SB100X transposase was provided as mRNA. Our optimized protocol allowed in a single electroporation an efficient depletion of HLA-I and TCR complexes, with more than 69% of double negative cells, and an efficient CAR delivery, that was slightly reduced when CAR and RNP were delivered together (average of 46.8% vs 32.4%) ( Figures 5A, B ,  S8 ). Genome-edited CD33-CAR-T cells were further purified using magnetic beads which yielded >98% double-negative cells while maintaining the percentage of transduction (CAR+ cells) ( Figures 5C, D ,  S8 ). The proliferation capacity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells, although not significant, was slightly reduced compared to non-edited CAR-T cells, an effect that was also observed in UTDKO cells, consistent with the effect of electroporation ( Figure 5E ). Moreover, no differences were observed in terms of CD4/CD8 ratio, population subsets, or the expression of activation and exhaustion markers ( Figures 5F, G ,  S9 ), indicating that HLA-I and TCR depletion did not affect CAR-T cell phenotype. Then in vitro cytotoxicity of CD33-CAR-TKO cells against MOLM-13 cells was equivalent to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure 5H ). Moreover, although proliferation was slightly reduced after continuous restimulation with tumoral cells, CD33-CAR-TKO cells also presented similar cytotoxic activity to non-edited CAR-T cells ( Figure S9 ). Finally, although the in vivo antitumoral potential in a xenograft model in NSG mice was slightly reduced compared to previous results, where some total remissions were observed, no differences were observed between CD33-CAR-TKO and CD33-CAR-T cells ( Figures 5I ,  S9 ). These results indicate that CD33-CAR-TKO cells generated from healthy donors could be an efficient approach to overcome dysfunctional features observed in CAR-T cells from AML patients."

84,PMC10546312,RESULTS,title_2,Safety analysis of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CD33-CAR-T cells
85,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"The safety of edited cells remains a concern for human application. Analysis of genomic DNA found a similar number of transposon copies in CD33-CAR-TKO cells compared to non-edited CAR-T cells generated with the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, with an average of 7.3 and 7.5 respectively ( Figure 6A ). Moreover, integration site analysis revealed a safe integration profile of the CAR, with no differences due to CRISPR modifications. We mapped and characterized a total of 94148 unique insertion sites of three independent CD33-CAR-TKO and CAR-T cell productions. Most of the insertions were located at the expected AT-rich DNA regions of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system, detecting the palindromic ATATATAT motif, which contains the TA dinucleotide target sequence adjacent to all the insertions ( Figure S10 ). Moreover, CAR insertions presented a wide distribution within the genome, with no preferences for promoter or exonic regions, and most of the insertions were located at distal intergenic regions ( Figures 6B ,  S10 ). An additional potential issue associated with CRISPR-based genome editing would be the genotoxicity due to non-specific cleavage of the genome. Thus, we used iGUIDE, a modification of the GUIDE-seq method, to analyze the CRISPR-mediated cleavage specificity. We observed a highly specific editing of the β2M and TRAC locus, with no significant off-target sites ( Figure 6C ). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that CRISPR-mediated HLA-I and TCR knockout do not alter the safe integration profile of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system without inducing unspecific cleavage of the DNA."

88,PMC10546312,RESULTS,paragraph,"Finally, to determine the feasibility and consistency of the process for further clinical application, we optimized the production of edited CD33-CAR-TKO cells at a large scale. Thus, 50x106 T cells were electroporated with equivalent scaled proportions of Sleeping Beauty transposon system (MC + mRNA) and RNP (Cas9 + sgRNA). Electroporated CAR-T cells were expanded using the G-Rex platform and CD33-CAR-TKO cells were selected at the end of the expansion phase using AutoMACS. No differences were observed in editing efficiency before CD33-CAR-TKO cell selection, with more than 70% of double negative cells, or in the purity of selected cells ( Figure 7A ). The analysis of the purified CD33-CAR-TKO cells revealed no differences in the transduction efficiency and expansion capacity (population doublings), allowing the generation of at least >300x106 of purified CD33-CAR-TKO cells at the end of the procedure ( Figures 7B–D ). Moreover, CD33-CAR-TKO cells produced at the large scale were equally functional in terms of cytotoxic activity and IFN-γ production than previously produced CD33-CAR-TKO cells ( Figures 7E, F ). In summary, we have successfully developed a protocol for the efficient production and selection of fully functional gene-edited CAR-T cells, allowing the generation of large numbers of CD33-CAR-TKO cells, that could be compatible with clinical applications."

90,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
91,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,paragraph,"CAR-T therapies targeting CD19 and BCMA have demonstrated impressive results in B-cell malignancies, achieving long-term responses. However, similar results have not been obtained in other hematological diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Despite one of the main barriers hampering CAR-T cell efficacy in AML is the absence of AML-specific antigens, since most of the cell surface antigens present in AML blasts are also present in normal hematopoietic cells, for this work we selected CD33 as a model antigen for several reasons. CD33-CAR-T cells have shown some clinical efficacy, although mature clinical results have yet to be published, and Gemtuzumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, is already approved for the treatment of AML patients, supporting their role as an AML target. Moreover, allogeneic CD33-CAR-T cells have a promising therapeutic potential as a bridging therapy, prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, for some R/R AML patients. In this study, we addressed several strategies that may contribute to increasing the efficacy of CAR-T cells in AML. First have demonstrated that modifications of different CAR moieties impact the CAR-T cell response. As described for other CAR constructs hinge length and scFv sequence affected CAR activation and tonic signaling, pointing out that optimal configurations are required for efficient recognition. Although this optimization cannot be generalized and should be evaluated for each antigen, we observed that CAR constructs derived from the my96 clone had better antigen-dependent responses probably due to the increased affinity for CD33. The hinge length had a less critical role, but results suggested that shorter versions presented better outcomes, although more experiments should be performed to clarify this point. Other modifications such as changes in the costimulatory domain barely affected CAR-T functionality, especially in vivo, where similar antitumoral efficacy was observed between 4-1BB and CD28 CD33-CAR-T cells using NSG xenograft models. Differences in efficacy associated with co-stimulatory molecules have been described, in part related to activation of different signaling transduction pathways. The reasons for the absence of differences in our case might be explained in part by the aggressivity of the AML model, since a few thousand MOLM-13 cells are able to induce animal death in 2 weeks."
92,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although several studies have consistently indicated that the fitness of T cells is compromised in patients with AML, our study contributes to understanding some of the regulatory mechanisms underlying these abnormalities. Furthermore, it provides additional evidence that the fitness of the T cells has an impact on the phenotype and functional capacity of the CAR-T cells generated from those T cells. Beyond the impact that CAR-T cell manufacturing has on CAR-T cell phenotype, being more evident in senior samples, differences observed in T cells from AML patients were also translated into the CAR-T cells, presenting an even more differentiated, activated, and exhausted phenotypes, that resulted in a reduced antitumoral efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we identified changes that were age-related, since they were also observed in CAR-T cells from aged-matched healthy donors, which were more exacerbated after tumor recognition in AML CAR-T cells. Other differences, however, were intrinsic to AML, in particular the higher proportion of terminally differentiated effector CD8+ CAR-T cells with increased levels of exhaustion markers. These results are in accordance with studies performed in CAR-T cells from MM patients, another hematological disease mostly developed in elderly people. These features would explain the differences observed in the functionality of those AML CAR-T cells and would suggest that autologous CAR-T cell approaches could not be the best option for AML treatment. Recent studies have proposed the use of matched donor-derived allogeneic cells, that could partially overcome some of the limitations of autologous CAR-T cells."
93,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The use of allogeneic cells for the generation of CAR-T cells has been proposed as a means to generate an off-the-shelf product which has a number of advantages over autologous products. The use of fitter T-cells, the potential to generate many different dosages from a single donor and with significant reduction in costs need to be balanced with the limitations associated with allogeneic cells such as the development of GVHD and the need for additional immunosuppression to facilitate engraftment. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated the possibility of manufacturing gene-edited CAR-T cells for the treatment of patients with MM or ALL. Different technologies, including TALEN nucleases or CRISPR systems, have been explored to prevent immune rejection and GvHD, generally by eliminating the expression of endogenous TCR and HLA-I complexes. Editing of additional genes (i.e. PD1, CD52, HLA-II, etc…) would represent a promising option to improve allogeneic CAR-T therapies, by increasing antitumoral efficacy (PD1 disruption) and/or increasing CAR-T cell persistence (CD52 knock-out). Moreover, the use of novel gene editing technologies, such as base-editing tools, would represent a promising and safer option under evaluation for the generation of allogeneic CAR-T cells. However, the large-scale production compatible with clinical applications, as well as the clinical efficacy and safety of these multiple-gene edited CAR-T cells still needs to be demonstrated. Our results have combined two state-of-the-art technologies to generate a ready-to-use allogeneic CD33-CAR-T product, the CRISPR systems and non-viral Sleeping Beauty (SB) based transposon systems. We have optimized the manufacturing protocol reducing the critical steps that compromise cell viability and simplifying the overall procedure. In contrast to recently published protocols, where the CAR transduction and editing steps are performed sequentially, our protocol uses a single electroporation step for the efficient delivery of the CAR and the efficient depletion of both HLA-I and TCR complexes. Although the transduction efficiency is slightly reduced in the edited cell, with a lower number of CAR+ cells our protocol is able to generate enough cells compatible with clinical applications. In accordance with previous studies, we have also demonstrated that double HLA-I and TCR-depleted CAR-T cells (CAR-TKO cells) have similar features to non-edited CAR-T cells. Moreover, although some variabilities were observed in the in vivo antitumoral efficacy, probably due to the aggressivity of the tumor model and the donor’s variability, CAR-TKO cells are fully functional. In summary, although additional studies related to CAR-TKO cell persistence could be performed to better characterize this aspect in long-term applications, our results would support the use of these CAR-TKO cells for therapeutic approaches in R/R AML patients where CAR-T cells are used to reduce tumor burden as bridging therapy prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation."
94,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We have additionally performed a set of analyses to confirm the safety of CAR-TKO cells. The combination of the SB transposon system with CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) does not alter either the vector copy number or the insertion site, indicating that CAR-TKO cells maintain the safe integration profile described for SB transposon system. Moreover, off-target analysis using improved technologies for unbiased genome-wide analysis, corroborated that CRISPR-mediated modifications were specific without significant off-targets. Although the absence of off-targets was expected for the sgRNA targeting the TRAC locus, since it was already described and validated in the literature, the b2M sgRNA was specifically designed for this study, and safety assessment was a requirement for potential clinical translation. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of these two sgRNAs are very efficient and specific. Moreover, based on previous results using the same or similar sgRNAs, we could anticipate that safety issues related to chromosomal rearrangements would be unlikely. In the future, and in order to move to clinical application additional analysis, like CAST-seq, should be performed to corroborate genomic safety. Finally, we have demonstrated that our protocol is scalable, being able to produce sufficient CAR-TKO cells compatible with clinical applications without compromising CAR-T functionality and purity. Moreover, our protocol for the generation of CAR-TKO cells is not restricted to CD33-targeting CAR-T cells, since delivery of the CAR construct and the HLA-I and TCR knock-out processes, although performed together, are independent processes. Thus, HLA-I and TCR disruption (or even other genes of interest) could be combined with any other CAR construct targeting a different antigen, either for AML treatment (i.e. CLL1 or CD44v6) or another relevant disease (i.e. solid tumors). Although currently CAR-T cell manufacturing has a tendency toward the automatization of procedures, as described recently, our approach reduces the number of steps required for production. Moreover, the expansion of the cells in G-Rex devices is compatible with further automatizations in the fill and finish steps, which should be optimized using GMP procedures."
95,PMC10546312,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, our work demonstrates that CAR-T cells from AML patients, although functional, present phenotypic and functional features that could compromise their antitumoral efficacy, compared to CAR-T cells from healthy donors. The combination of CRISPR technologies with transposon-based delivery strategies allows the generation of HLA-IKO/TCRKO CAR-T cells, compatible with allogeneic approaches, that would represent a promising option for AML treatment."

107,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Background
108,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide. BC stem cells (BCSCs) have been known to be involved in the carcinogenesis of the breast and contribute to therapeutic resistance. The programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression of BC correlated with a poor prognosis. Immunotherapies that target PD-L1 have great potential and have been successful when applied to cancer treatment. However, whether PD-L1 regulates BCSC formation is unknown."
109,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Methods
110,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract,"BCSCs were enriched by serum-free suspension culture. The properties of BCSCs were examined by mammosphere formation assay, CD44+/Cd24−, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) assay, CSC marker analysis, and mammosphere growth assay. To elucidate the functions of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), nuclear PD-L1, and RelB proteins in the stemness of BCSCs, mammosphere formation was examined using BRD4 inhibitor and degrader, PD-L1 degrader, and RelB inhibitor. The antitumor function of 3',4',7,8-tetrahydroxyflavone (THF), a specific BRD4 inhibitor, was studied through in vivo tumor model and mouse studies, and the protein levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB were examined in tumor model under THF treatment."
111,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Results
112,PMC10623882,ABSTRACT,abstract,"BRD4 was upregulated in breast CSCs and regulates the stemness of BCs. The downregulation of BRD4 using BRD4 PROTAC, ARV-825, and BRD4 inhibitor, (+)-JQ1, inhibits mammosphere formation and reduces the levels of breast CSC markers (CD44+/CD24− and ALDH1), stem cell marker genes, and mammosphere growth. BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825) downregulate membrane and nuclear fractions of PD-L1 through the inhibition of PD-L1 transcript levels. The knockdown of PD-L1 inhibits mammosphere formation. Verteporfin, a PD-L1 degrader, inhibits the transcripts and protein levels of PD-L1 and downregulates the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Calcitriol, a RelB inhibitor, and the knockdown of RelB using si-RelB regulate mammosphere formation through interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression. THF is a natural product and a potent selective BRD4 inhibitor, inhibits mammosphere formation, and reduces the levels of CD44+/CD24− and mammosphere growth by downregulating c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB. 3',4',7,8-THF shows tumoricidal activity and increased levels of CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T-cells in the tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) in the murine tumor model using 4T1 and MC38 cells."

BC involves lobules, ducts, and connective tissue of the breast and has different physiological properties and clinical outcomes. Breast cancer can be divided into luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpressing, and TNBC. TNBC accounts for 15–20% of BCs. Patients with TNBC showed a poorer prognosis than patients with other BCs. Despite advanced interventions, relapse and metastasis of BC reduced survival rates. These interventions are not the best option for the treatment of BC metastasis. Understanding BC tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways might help in the development of a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. BC stem cells (BCSCs) are BC subpopulations and play an important role in the metastasis of BC and resistance to chemotherapy. BCSCs are capable of self-renewal and differentiate into cancer cells. Much data show that BCSCs cause tumor progression and drug resistance to conventional therapy. Targeting breast CSCs may be a good tool for BC treatment."
120,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"BRD4 is a transcriptional and epigenetic factor that plays a vital role in embryogenesis and cancer development and is a member of the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) family (BRD2, BRD3, and BRDT). Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (Brd4) supports tumor-driving oncogene expression. Since the BET family is a potential cancer therapeutic target, BET inhibitors are currently in preclinical and clinical trials for the treatment of multiple tumors. BRD4 regulates the self-renewal ability of glioma-initiating cells by interaction in the Notch1 promoter region and involvement of tumor metabolism. JQ1, BET (BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4) inhibitor, represents the anti-BCSC activity. BRD4 regulates the transcription factor △Np63α to induce the CSC phenotype in squamous cell carcinoma. However, whether the BRD4 signal is related to the formation of breast CSCs is unknown."
121,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) protein that is encoded by the CD274 gene in humans. The PD- programmed cell death protein 11/PD-L1 axis inhibits T-cell activation and cytotoxic secretion in tumors, is responsible for the cancer immune escape, and makes a huge effect on cancer therapy. PD-L1 plays an important role in inhibiting immune response by modulating T-cell activation and inducing apoptosis of antigen-specific T-cells. PD-L1 attenuates the host immune response to tumor cells. Therefore, the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is responsible for cancer immune escape and gives bad effects on cancer therapy. PD-L1 is overexpressed on breast CSCs through the notch3/mTOR axis and enhanced colorectal cancer stem cell (CSC) formation by activating the HMGA1-dependent pathway. Immune checkpoint Inhibitor therapy is one of the most promising anticancer therapies. Antibodies against the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been applied to several cancers and have demonstrated good efficacy. Nevertheless, monotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 of metastatic BC showed a poor response. The representative drug pembrolizumab contains an antibody that blocks PD-1 protein on the surface of T-cells, and chemotherapy as a first-line treatment is useful for the treatment of PD-L1-positive metastatic TNBC. CSCs are not just resistant to chemotherapy but also immunotherapy. Whether the PL-L1 of CSCs is related to the formation of breast CSCs is unknown."
122,PMC10623882,INTRO,paragraph,"Transcription factors of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) family regulating the immune responses have five members: c-Rel, p65 (RelA), RelB, p105/p50 (NF-κB1), and p100/p52 (NF-κB2). The NF-κB pathway activation plays an important role in the progression of BC, and levels of RelB protein are known to be very high in aggressive BC tissues, particularly in TNBC. RelB induced cell mobility and inhibited apoptosis of BC. RelB increased the proliferation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) through IMP3- and LIN28-mediated regulation. The constitutive activated NF-κB (p65/p50) has been seen in many tumor types and CSCs. However, whether the RelB of CSCs is related to breast CSC formation is unknown."

166,PMC10623882,RESULTS,title_2,BRD4 regulates the gene expression of PD-L1 and PD-L1 modulates breast CSC formation
167,PMC10623882,RESULTS,paragraph,"BET inhibitor, JQ-1, has shown suppression of PD-L1 expression levels in ovarian cancer and represents a treatment strategy for targeting PD-L1 expression. We checked PD-L1 and the effect of the BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (ARV825). The expressions of PD-L1 of BC cells and CSCs were analyzed, and they expressed PD-L1 (Fig. 3A). JQ1 and ARV825 decreased the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 (Fig. 3B, C). A previous paper showed that PD-L1 is located in the cellular membrane and nucleus through endocytosis and nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways. A research group reported that nuclear PD-L1 is independent of immune checkpoint function and inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor growth through sister chromatid cohesion of cancer cells. In addition, we confirmed that the morphology of the chromosome was changed when treated with verteporfin and siRNA of PD-L1 (Fig. S1). Our data show that JQ1 and ARV-825 reduced the total, membrane, cytoskeleton, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bond nuclear levels of PD-L1 protein (Fig. 3D, E). Initially, we checked the transcript levels of PD-L1 under BRD4 inhibitor and degrader treatment. The PD-L1-Luc reporter assay showed that JQ1 and ARV825 inhibit PD-L1 promoter activity based on the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3F) and suppressed the BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter by BRD4-ChIP assay (Figs. 3G and S2). BRD4 inhibition and degradation inhibit promoter activity and BRD4 binding of PD-L1 promoter. To examine the effects of PD-L1 on CSC formation, we checked CSC formation through siRNA-mediated silencing PD-L1.

The NF-κB pathway is a crucial factor in CSC formation and therapeutic target. As verteporfin decreases the intrinsic and interferon-induced PD-L1 expressions of six cancer cell lines, we checked the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 under verteporfin treatment. Verteporfin reduced the transcript and protein levels of PD-L1 at 2 µM Fig. 4A). As nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expression of RelB and the NF-κB pathway is a crucial factor of CSC formation, we checked the transcript and protein levels of RelB under verteporfin treatment. Verteporfin reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB at the same concentration that reduced PD-L1 (Fig. 4B). To investigate the function of RelB in breast CSC formation, we used BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and degrader (RV825). JQ1 and ARV825 reduced the transcript and protein levels of RelB (Fig. 4C). We investigated RelB function on CSC formation through RelB silencing. The siRNA-mediated silencing of RelB inhibits the formation of breast CSCs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4D). We used RelB inhibitor, 1α, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, also known as calcitriol. Calcitriol reduced the protein levels of RelB and inhibits cell proliferation at 20 µM and mammosphere formation at 25 µM (Fig. 4E). Our data show that RelB regulates breast CSC formation."

173,PMC10623882,RESULTS,paragraph,"RelB/p65 (RelA) complex promotes NF-κB target genes such as TNF and IL-6 in ER-negative BC. We examined the interaction of RelB and p65 to understand the CSC regulation of RelB. Figure 5 A shows that RelB and p65 (RelA) interact with each other. The downregulation of p65 using siRNA of p65 reduced the mammosphere formation of BC (Fig. 5B). We used caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) to investigate CSC regulation by nuclear p65 activity. CAPE has strong inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation through the inhibition of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. We assayed cell proliferation, mammosphere formation, and nuclear localization of p65 using CAPE (Fig. 5C). Our results showed that CAPE did not change cell proliferation, but inhibited mammosphere formation and nuclear localization of p65. CSC formation is regulated by the nuclear location of p65, the NF-κB component. Cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-8, regulated by NF-κB proteins regulated breast CSC population. The levels of CSC-regulating cytokines, IL-6 and IL-8, were examined under a BRD4 inhibitor, PD-L1 inhibitor, RelB inhibitor, and p65 inhibitor treatments. The RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) and p65 inhibitor (CAPE) only inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig. 6A). The BRD4 inhibitor (JQ1) and PD-L1 inhibitor (verteporfin) also inhibited the transcript of IL-6 (Fig. 6B, C). Then, we performed the ChIP assay to identify RelB and p65 binding of the IL-6 promoter using a PCR primer set spanning the IL-6 promoter (Figs. 6D and S3). RelB inhibitor (calcitriol) endogenously reduced the IL-6 promoter binding affinity of RelB and p65. The IL-6 gene of breast CSCs is regulated by RelB and p65 protein through the binding of the IL-6 promoter. Secretory IL-6 and IL-8 play essential roles in mammosphere formation. To assess the production of secretory IL-6 and IL-8, we performed a human inflammatory cytokine assay on mammosphere-cultured broth using cytokine assay beads. The human inflammatory cytokine data indicated that inhibitors only reduce the production of secretory IL-6, not IL-8 (Fig. 6E). We performed the rescue experiments using the PD-L1 overexpression plasmid to understand the role of the existence of the BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL-6 axis in breast CSCs. For the rescue of BRD4-dependent PD-L1 degradation, the PD-L1_GFP expression vector was transfection into breast cancer cells with/without ARV-825 (BRD4 degrader). BRD4 degrader reduced BRD4, PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels and overexpression of PD-L1 of ARV-825 treated breast cancers increased reduced PD-L1, RelB, and IL-6 levels (Fig. 6F).

As THF has an anti-proliferative effect on MC-38 cells, we used an in vivo mouse model to examine whether it reduces tumor growth (Fig. 9A and Fig. S5A). The body weights of the control and THF-treated C57BL/6 and BALB/c murine mice did not change (Fig. 9B and Fig. S5B).

186,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"CSCs have been isolated and established from human tumors and are the driving forces of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Targeting CSC self-renewal or stemness was known as an effective cancer therapy. Previous reports have shown that combined inhibition of BRD4 and RAC1 suppresses growth, stemness, and tumorigenesis by disrupting the c-MYC/G9a/FTH1axis. In this study, we examined the biological function of targeting BRD4 using siRNA, inhibitor, and degrader on breast CSCs. We showed that the siRNA for BRD4, a specific inhibitor of BET family proteins (JQ1), and BRD4 protein degrader (ARV-825) suppress mammosphere formation, ALDH1 activity, CD44+/CD24− subpopulation, CSC growth, and specific survival factor of CSCs. The expression level of CSC BRD4 is higher than that in BCs (Figs. 1 and 2). BRD4 participates in breast CSC formation and the tumorigenic activity of MC38 derived from tumors (Figs. 1 and 9)."
187,PMC10623882,DISCUSS,paragraph,"BRD4 can regulate PD-L1 expression in TNBC. We examined the biological function of PD-L1 by targeting PD-L1 using siRNA, BRD4 inhibitors (JQ1 and ARV-825), and PD-L1 degrader (verteporfin) on breast CSCs. We found that siRNA for PD-L1, a specific inhibitor of BET family proteins (JQ1), and BRD4 protein degrader (ARV-825) suppress mammosphere formation. BRD4 inhibition reduced the expression levels of the membrane, cytoskeleton, and nuclear fraction (Fig. 3). For the first time, we showed that nuclear PD-L1 regulated mammosphere formation. PD-L1 or B7-H1 is well known for its role in immune checkpoint regulation as membrane function. Nuclear PD-L1 of cancer cells regulated the sister chromatid cohesion of BC and was independent of its function in the immune checkpoint. Nuclear PD-L1 regulated gene expressions of NF-κB signaling (BIRC3, RelB, and TRAP1), MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-H), and immune checkpoint (PD-L2, VISTA, and B&-H3). NF-κB signaling is essential for breast CSC formation. We checked whether verteporfin (a PD-L1 degrader) can downregulate the transcript and protein levels of RelB. Verteporfin downregulated the transcript and protein levels of RelB (Fig. 4). The siRNA and inhibitor of RelB (calcitriol) suppressed mammosphere formation, and for the first time, we showed that RelB regulated mammosphere formation. The RelB/RelA (p65) complex promotes the transcript of the NF-kB target gene and IL-6 gene of ER-negative BC. RelB interacts with RelA (p65), and the RelB/RelA (p65) complex binds the promoter sequence of the IL-6 gene (Fig. 6). A new finding is that the RelB protein regulates breast CSC formation through IL-6 regulation. Our results indicated that RelB may be a potential target of BC therapy."

We examined the relationship between PD-L1 and CSC formation on MC38 colorectal cancer, MC38-derived tumor, and 4T1-derived tumor using THF, a natural compound of BRD4 inhibitor. CSCs from MC38 colorectal cancer and MC38-derived tumors showed that THF inhibited CSC formation and induced apoptosis of MC38-derived CSCs through the c-Myc/BRD4/PD-L1/RelB/IL6 axis (Fig. 8). THF reduced the MC38-derived and 4T1-derived tumor volume and weight, and the inhibitor-treated tumor showed reduced expression levels of c-Myc, PD-L1, and RelB.

218,PMC10698577,TITLE,front,Glucocorticoids modulate neural activity via a rapid non-genomic effect on Kv2.2 channels in the central nervous system
219,PMC10698577,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Glucocorticoids are primary stress hormones that exert neuronal effects via both genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways. However, their rapid non-genomic effects and underlying mechanisms on neural activities remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated the rapid non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.2 channels in cultured HEK293 cells and acute brain slices including cortical pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses in the brain stem. We found that cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, rapidly increased Kv2.2 currents by increasing the single-channel open probability in Kv2.2-expressing HEK293 cells through activation of the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor. Bovine serum albumin-conjugated dexamethasone, a membrane-impermeable agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, could mimic the effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 channels. The cortisol-increased Kv2.2 currents were induced by activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinase, which could be inhibited by U0126, an antagonist of the ERK signaling pathway. In layer 2 cortical pyramidal neurons and the calyx of Held synapses, cortisol suppressed the action potential firing frequency during depolarization and reduced the successful rate upon high-frequency stimulation by activating Kv2.2 channels. We further examined the postsynaptic responses and found that cortisol did not affect the mEPSC and evoked EPSC, but increased the activity-dependent synaptic depression induced by a high-frequency stimulus train. In conclusion, glucocorticoids can rapidly activate Kv2.2 channels through membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, suppress presynaptic action potential firing, and inhibit synaptic transmission and plasticity. This may be a universal mechanism of the glucocorticoid-induced non-genomic effects in the central nervous system."
220,PMC10698577,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
221,PMC10698577,INTRO,paragraph,"Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rats and mice, are produced by the zona fasciculata cells of the adrenal cortex in a diurnal pattern under the control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoids play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, immune function, and the response to stress. They have been widely acknowledged as stress hormones, and their production markedly increases following exposure to stress. In the mammalian brain, stress-induced elevations in glucocorticoids induce variable neuronal effects via both genomic and non-genomic signaling pathways. The genomic pathway, which has been well studied, is mainly mediated by the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. Activated by glucocorticoid binding, the glucocorticoid receptors undergo conformational changes and translocate to the nucleus to regulate cellular gene expression. For example, stress-induced increases in the glucocorticoid level induce neuronal structure changes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. However, the non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids, which usually occur within a few minutes and depend on the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor, are still not fully understood."
222,PMC10698577,INTRO,paragraph,"Increasing evidence indicates that the rapid non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids may be related to the ion channels on the cell membrane. A previous study showed that cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, can rapidly increase the large conductance calcium and the voltage-dependent potassium currents (IK) in rat chromaffin cells. Cortisol can also rapidly inhibit Kv1.3 channels in the rat paraventricular nucleus and L-type calcium channels in the tilapia prolactin cells. Interestingly, the level of glucocorticoids in the brain oscillates constantly. Recent studies show that the ultradian rhythmicity of glucocorticoids is critical in regulating normal emotional and cognitive responses in humans. Glucocorticoids may regulate neural activity through rapid non-genomic effects during these fluctuations."
223,PMC10698577,INTRO,paragraph,"The Kv2 channel family, which consists of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2, plays a vital role in modulating neural excitability. Kv2.1 is expressed throughout the mammalian brain, whereas Kv2.2 is preferentially expressed in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the brain stem, basal forebrain, and layers 2 and 5a of the neocortex. The Kv2 channels are critical for maintaining high-frequency action potential (AP) firing upon intense stimulation."
224,PMC10698577,INTRO,paragraph,"The calyx of Held synapse, a giant glutamatergic synapse located in the MNTB of the brainstem, provides great convenience for investigating both pre-and postsynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission. Previous studies have demonstrated that Kv2.2 is highly expressed in the MNTB and involved in maintaining high-frequency AP firing by facilitating the recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivation."
225,PMC10698577,INTRO,paragraph,"In the present study, we investigated the rapid non-genomic effect of cortisol, the endogenous glucocorticoids, on Kv2.2 channels that were overexpressed in HEK293 cells and brain slices, including cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons and the calyx-type synapses. We found that glucocorticoids rapidly increase the Kv2.2 channel currents via the glucocorticoid receptors on the cell membrane and phosphorylation of the ERK pathway. Cortisol significantly reduces the AP firing rate in cortical pyramidal neurons and the presynaptic nerve terminals of the calyx-type synapses through Kv2.2 channels. The similar effects in the prefrontal cortex and brainstem in our results may suggest a possible universal mechanism for the rapid non-genomic glucocorticoid-induced effect in the brain."

A 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV was applied to induce a potassium current in HEK293 cells and cortical pyramidal neurons. To analyze the steady-state activation and inactivation of Kv2.2 currents, the normalized conductance or currents was fitted using the Boltzmann equation: G/Gmax = A2 + (A1 − A2)/(1 + exp((Vm − V1/2)/slope factor)). For cortical pyramidal neuron AP recordings, cortical slices were perfused in normal ACSFPFC solution; the pipette (3–5 MΩ) solution contained (in mM): 150 K-gluconate, 10 HEPES, 8 NaCl, 0.4 EGTA, 0.1 Na3-GTP, and 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH.

The extracellular and pipette solutions were the same as for the whole-cell recording in HEK293 cells. For leak subtractions, null sweeps (traces with no channel opening) were averaged and subtracted from the recordings. Single-channel analysis was accomplished with Clampfit10.7 (Molecular Devices, USA). The unitary conductance was determined from the slope of the linear fit of the channel current induced by depolarizing from −110 to +10 mV (20 mV step). To evaluate the potassium channel open probability, the patches were depolarized from the resting membrane potential (around −70 mV) to test potentials of +10 mV for 400 ms. The open probability was calculated from the total channel opening time divided by the duration of the depolarizing stimulus."

260,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"Non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids can be glucocorticoid receptor-dependent or -independent. Next, we investigated whether cortisol increases Kv2.2 currents via glucocorticoid receptors. We found that 1 μM dexamethasone, the artificial synthetic cortisol analog, could significantly increase the Kv2.2 currents induced by a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV in HEK293 cells (131.5 ± 4.4%; n = 7; p = 0.0019, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2A). Bath application of RU486 (10 μM), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, completely abolished the cortisol-induced increase in Kv2.2 currents (102.5 ± 3.0%; n = 9; p = 0.2926, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2B). In addition, RU486 itself had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (n = 7; p = 0.6082, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2C). These results suggest that cortisol increases the Kv2.2 current via the glucocorticoid receptor-dependent pathway."
261,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"The glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to be expressed both on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm, raising the question of which receptors are responsible for the non-genomic effects of cortisol. Previous studies have indicated that the non-genomic effects of glucocorticoids are most likely mediated via the glucocorticoid receptors on the cell membrane. To test this hypothesis, we applied 1 μM BSA-conjugated dexamethasone, a membrane-impermeable agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor, to the extracellular solution and found a similar increase in Kv2.2 currents compared to the dexamethasone-treated group (136.0 ± 4.2% of the control group; n = 7; p = 0.0025, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2D).

262,PMC10698577,RESULTS,title_2,Glucocorticoids increase Kv2.2 currents via the ERK1/2 signaling pathway
263,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"Previous studies have reported that cortisol exerts its effects via several signaling pathways downstream of the glucocorticoid receptors, including the PKA, PKC, and ERK signaling pathways. First, we used staurosporine, a nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor, to test whether the stimulatory effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 occurs through protein kinase signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 2F, staurosporine abolished the stimulatory effect of cortisol on Kv2.2 (93.8 ± 5.0% compared with the staurosporine-treated group; n = 6; p = 0.4994, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 2F). To further determine the protein kinase signaling pathway through which cortisol facilitates Kv2.2 currents, we applied H-89 (10 μM, the PKA antagonist), Bis (1 μM, the PKC antagonist), and U0126 (10 μM, the ERK antagonist) to the extracellular solution to inhibit the three kinases. We found that neither H-89 nor Bis could suppress the cortisol-induced increase in the Kv2.2 currents (H-89: 126.1 ± 6.0%; n = 5; p = 0.0111, paired Student's t-test; BIS: 122.4 ± 2.2%; n = 5; p = 0.0273, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2G and H). However, 10 μM U0126 completely abolished the cortisol-facilitated Kv2.2 current (104.5 ± 4.0%; n = 8; p = 0.3366, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2I), suggesting that cortisol increases the Kv2.2 current via the ERK signaling pathway. Acutely application of H-89, Bis or U0126 had no effect on Kv2.2 currents (Fig. 2J). We further examined whether the ERK kinase was activated by cortisol in Western blot experiments. Five-minute treatment with 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells (144.4 ± 13.4%; n = 5; p = 0.030; paired Student's t-test; Fig. 2K).

268,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"After demonstrating the non-genomic effect of glucocorticoids in HEK293 cells that overexpress Kv2.2 channels, we considered the differences between the HEK293 cell line and brain neurons. We investigated the rapid non-genomic effects of cortisol on native Kv2.2 channels in brain slices. We examined the effect of cortisol in mouse cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons and the rat giant calyx-type synapses located in the brain stem, where Kv2.2 channels have been reported to be preferentially expressed. In cortical pyramidal neurons, we elicited the IK using a 200-ms depolarization pulse from −80 to +40 mV. Bath application of 10 μM cortisol for 5 min significantly increased the rectified outward IK by 28.0 ± 1.2% (Ctrl: 1.8 ± 0.3 nA; Cortisol: 2.3 ± 0.4 nA; n = 5; p = 0.0036, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3A). Corticosterone had a similar effect on the IK in the pyramidal neurons to that of cortisol (n = 8; p = 0.0009, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3B). Moreover, in the presence of corticosterone, additional treatment with cortisol did not further increase the IK currents (Fig. 3B), indicating that the effects of cortisone and cortisol on the potassium channel currents are mediated through the same signaling pathway. To determine whether the cortisol-increased IK in the pyramidal neurons was mediated by Kv2.2 channels, we selectively inhibited the Kv2.2 channels via intracellular application of Kv2.2-specific antibody in the pipette solution using a whole-cell configuration. Approximately 1–2 min after break-in, Kv2.2-specific antibody dramatically reduced the IK by 51.6 ± 4.9% (Ctrl: 2.3 ± 0.3 nA; Anti-Kv2.2: 1.2 ± 0.2 nA; n = 5; p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), and additional application of 10 μM cortisol to the extracellular solution for 5 min could no longer increase the IK (88.3 ± 11.8% compared to the IK with Kv2.2 antibody; n = 5; p = 0.4311, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 3C), confirming that Kv2.2 plays a dominant role in mediating the cortisol-induced increase in the potassium current in cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons. To further confirm the involvement of Kv2.2 channels in the cortisol-induced increase of IK, we used lentivirus vectors to deliver shRNA targeted to affect post-translational silencing of the Kv2.2 gene in the pyramidal neurons. First, the knockdown efficiency of the shRNA was tested in HEK293 cells overexpressing Kv2.2 (KD-Kv2.2: 39.2 ± 2.5%; n = 3; p = 0.0017, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, left). The shRNA targeting Kv2.2 channels reduced IK by 62.3% in the pyramidal neurons (Scramble: 2.6 ± 0.3 nA; n = 4; KD-Kv2.2: 1.0 ± 0.3 nA; n = 6; p = 0.0016, unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. 3D, right). The knockdown of Kv2.2 channels mimicked Kv2.2 antibody-induced inhibition of the cortisol-induced increase in Kv2.2 currents (KD-Kv2.2: 1.1 ± 0.2 nA; n = 6; KD-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 1.1 ± 0.2 nA; n = 6; p = 0.7077, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3E). Similar to our observations in HEK293 cells above, RU486 (10 μM) or U0126 (10 μM) abolished the cortisol-induced increase in IK in the cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor and ERK1/2 signaling pathway, respectively (RU486 + cortisol compared to the IK with RU486: 104.3 ± 2.4%; n = 8; p = 0.1212, paired Student's t-test; U0126 + cortisol compared to the IK with U0126: 96.9 ± 1.6%; n = 8; p = 0.1471, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 3F and G). Western blots experiment further demonstrated that cortisol increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 kinase in cortical pyramidal neurons (131.8 ± 3.2%; n = 4; p = 0.0023, unpaired Student's t-test; Fig. 3H), indicating that cortisol increases the native Kv2.2 channel currents via the glucocorticoid receptor/ERK signaling pathway in cortical layer 2 pyramidal neurons."

In cortical pyramidal neurons, repetitive AP firings were elicited by the injection of a 1 s, 200-pA current via a whole-cell configuration.

281,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"At the calyx-type synapse, we induced single AP at the presynaptic nerve terminal by injecting 1 ms, 100–300 pA current in the current clamp configuration (Fig. 6A). Administration of cortisol (10 μM) to the extracellular solution did not affect the resting membrane potential (Ctrl: −68.2 ± 1.4 mV, Cortisol: −69.4 ± 1.8 mV; n = 9; p = 0.3237, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6B), and we did not observe significant differences in AP amplitude (Ctrl: 106.3 ± 1.3 mV, Cortisol: 106.8 ± 1.6 mV; n = 9; p = 0.7847, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6C) or half-width (Ctrl: 0.54 ± 0.03 ms, Cortisol: 0.62 ± 0.06 ms; n = 9; p = 0.2733, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6D) after bath application of cortisol for 5 min. We also induced repetitive AP firing by injecting a 1s, 300 pA current (Fig. 6E). Cortisol significantly reduced the AP frequency at the presynaptic nerve terminal (Ctrl: 15.0 ± 4.8 Hz; Cortisol: 6.4 ± 2.5 Hz; n = 7; p = 0.0167, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6F, top), consistent with what we have seen in the cortical pyramidal neurons. We also compared the bursting firing frequency and found that cortisol also significantly reduced the bursting frequency (Ctrl: 4.9 ± 1.4 Hz; Cortisol: 2.0 ± 0.8 Hz; n = 7; p = 0.0437, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6F, bottom). Intracellular application of Kv2.2 antibody (1:200) via the pipette solution decreased the AP frequency (Ctrl: 13.9 ± 2.4 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2: 10.1 ± 1.8 Hz; n = 8; p = 0.0221, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6G and H, top), and additional application of 10 μM cortisol to the extracellular solution could not further reduce the frequency (Anti-Kv2.2: 10.1 ± 1.8 Hz; Anti-Kv2.2 + cortisol: 9.1 ± 1.6 Hz; n = 8; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 6H, top).

282,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"At calyces, the neuronal firing can be increased to 600 Hz upon stimulation. Therefore, we induced 1 s AP firing by 1 ms, 300 pA depolarizing current injections at 10, 50, 100, and 200 Hz. We found that the APs at the nerve terminal were 100% successful at 10 Hz, and cortisol could not reduce the successful rate (Fig. 6I, top left). However, at higher stimulation frequencies, cortisol gradually inhibited the AP success rate in a frequency-dependent manner (50 Hz: Ctrl, 69 ± 13%; Cortisol, 66 ± 14%; n = 5; p = 0.3739, paired Student's t-test; 100 Hz: Ctrl, 51 ± 13%; Cortisol, 32 ± 12%; n = 5; p = 0.0025, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 26 ± 5%; Cortisol, 13 ± 6%; n = 5; p = 0.0328, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6I and J). In addition, Kv2.2 antibody (1:200) in the pipette solution abolished the cortisol-induced inhibition of the AP successful rate at all stimulation frequencies (50 Hz: Ctrl, 70 ± 15%; Cortisol, 62 ± 17%; n = 5; p = 0.4630, paired Student's t-test; 100 Hz: Ctrl, 47 ± 15%; Cortisol, 46 ± 16%; n = 5; p = 0.7151, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 11 ± 3%; Cortisol, 8 ± 2%; n = 5; p = 0.0793, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 6K and L).

287,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"Presynaptic AP triggers neurotransmitter release and evokes the postsynaptic response. We further investigated whether the cortisol-induced presynaptic inhibition affects the postsynaptic responses at the calyx-type synapse. We elicited two consecutive EPSCs at the principal neuron via a pair of brief stimulations with a bipolar electrode every 10 s. Bicuculline (10 μM) was added to the extracellular solution to inhibit GABAA-mediated currents. PPR was used to evaluate the changes in release probability. After 5 min baseline recording, cortisol (10 μM) was applied to the extracellular solution for 15 min, and then washed out for another 10 min (Fig. 7A). We found that the EPSC amplitude, PPR, rise time, and decay time were not significantly changed with cortisol treatment, suggesting that cortisol did not affect either the characteristics of the postsynaptic responses or the presynaptic release probability (Fig. 7B–D). We also measured the mEPSCs to examine whether cortisol can modulate the sensitivity of the postsynaptic AMPA receptors (Fig. 7E). All mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of −80 mV with 50 μM APV and 10 μM bicuculline in the extracellular solution to inhibit the NMDA and GABAA-receptors mediated currents. The mean mEPSC amplitude and frequency in controls were 32.1 ± 1.8 pA and 1.2 ± 0.3 Hz, respectively (2528 events from 7 calyces; Fig. 7F and G). The 10–90% rise time and 20–80% decay time were 0.34 ± 0.02 ms and 1.69 ± 0.08 ms, respectively (n = 7; Fig. 7I and J). Administration of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution did not change the amplitude (32.7 ± 2.0 pA, 2112 events from 7 calyces, p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7F) or frequency (1.0 ± 0.2 Hz; p = 0.3467; one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7G). The 10–90% rise time and 20–80% decay time were also not affected (Cortisol-treated group: 10–90% rise time, 0.32 ± 0.02 ms; 20–80% decay time,1.66 ± 0.07 ms; n = 7; p > 0.9999, one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test; Fig. 7I and J). The results of the EPSC and mEPSC recordings were consistent with the observation that cortisol did not affect the presynaptic AP firing at low frequency (Fig. 6)."
288,PMC10698577,RESULTS,paragraph,"We further explored how EPSCs were affected under intense stimulation. We evoked 40 EPSCs at 5, 50, 100, and 200 Hz at the postsynaptic principal neuron via fiber stimulation in the presence of 10 μM cortisol in the extracellular solution. Cortisol induced an increased activity-dependent synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation trains. The success rate was dramatically decreased when the stimulation frequency was higher than 100 Hz (100 Hz: Ctrl, 97.1 ± 1.4%; Cortisol, 98.3 ± 1.1%; n = 6; p = 0.0756, paired Student's t-test; 200 Hz: Ctrl, 52.1 ± 5.0%; Cortisol, 33.8 ± 4.4%; n = 6; p = 0.0011, paired Student's t-test; Fig. 7K and L).

These results indicated that cortisol strongly enhanced the synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation."
289,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
290,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Glucocorticoids have been reported to induce diverse effects via genomic and non-genomic mechanisms in the mammalian brain. In the present study, we, for the first time, reported that glucocorticoids rapidly increase the Kv2.2 channel currents in neurons through the glucocorticoid receptors on the cell membrane. We further investigated the underlying signaling pathway and found that phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 pathway, but not the PKA or PKC pathways, was involved in the rapid non-genomic modulation. Our findings may provide a new universal mechanism for glucocorticoid-induced non-genomic effects in the central nervous system."
291,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The glucocorticoid-modulated effect on ion channels via classical genomic pathways, such as increasing cardiac sodium channel expression in the fetal ovine heart and epithelial sodium channel expression in fetal and adult guinea pig lungs, typically takes more than a few hours. A recent study also reported that corticosterone increases acid-sensing ion channel expression in rat hippocampal neurons. However, there are few reports on glucocorticoid's rapid effect (within minutes) on ion channels. A previous study reported that cortisol rapidly inhibits Kv1.5 current in Xenopus oocytes. Furthermore, the downstream signaling pathway of the glucocorticoid-induced rapid effect on ion channels remains elusive. Ffrench-Mullen reported that cortisol rapidly inhibits L-type calcium channels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons via the PKC signaling pathway. Previous studies have suggested that the specific kinase pathways involved in mediating the rapid effects of glucocorticoids can vary depending on the cellular context. For example, in the hippocampus, glucocorticoids have been found to enhance CA1 pyramidal excitability through activation of ERK1/2 kinase, whereas in the hypothalamus, they have been shown to inhibit glutamatergic synaptic activity of PVN parvocellular neurons through activation of the PKC pathway. In human bronchial epithelial cells, dexamethasone has been shown to decrease intracellular Ca2+ by activating PKA, whereas in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, dexamethasone has been reported to increase intracellular Ca2+ by deactivating ERK1/2 kinase. In the present study, we demonstrated that the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on Kv2.2 channels is associated with the activation of ERK instead of PKC, suggesting a variety of downstream glucocorticoid signaling pathways."
292,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptor is derived from the same gene as the classical cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor and has been reported to be widely expressed in various cell types. Glucocorticoids rapidly regulate BK and Kv1.3 channels via unknown membrane receptors or direct interaction with the channel. Our study provides direct evidence that glucocorticoids increase the Kv2.2 current through membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors with bath application of BSA-dexamethasone and RU486, the membrane-impermeable agonist and antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptors, respectively. After binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, glucocorticoids could further modulate the activities of various kinases, including PKA, PKC, and ERK. Previous studies have shown that dexamethasone rapidly (within 5 min) decreases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in human leukemia cell lines Nalm-6 and Reh and that BSA-conjugated corticosterone rapidly (within 15 min) inhibits the NMDA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cultured hippocampal neurons. However, Qiu et al. reported that corticosterone and BSA-conjugated corticosterone rapidly (within 15 min) activate ERK1/2 in PC12 cells. Our results also confirm that cortisol rapidly increases ERK1/2 activities in HEK293 cells and cortical neurons. These results indicate that the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on ERK1/2 could be diverse among different cell types. However, the underlying mechanisms that activate ERK1/2 through membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors need further investigation."
293,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The Kv2 family of voltage-gated potassium channels contains Kv2.1 and Kv2.2. The Kv2.1 channel has been reported to be widely expressed in the brain. However, previous studies have shown that the Kv2.2 channels were preferentially expressed in layer 2 pyramidal neurons, the basal forebrain, and the MNTB neurons. Kv2 channels are high voltage-activated (HVA) channels with slow activation kinetics and, therefore, contribute little to the resting membrane potential and single AP properties. Consistent with this, we found that cortisol did not change the resting membrane potentials and single AP properties in layer 2 pyramidal neurons and calyx-type synapses in the MNTB (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The effect of Kv2 on neuronal activity can be excitatory or inhibitory. Kv2 channels have been shown to facilitate repetitive AP firing by promoting recovery of voltage-gated sodium channels from inactivation. Inhibition of Kv2 channels could reduce the repetitive firing in MNTB neurons while increasing the fidelity of repetitive firing in dorsal root ganglia neurons. In previous studies, dexamethasone rapidly increased basal nitric oxide production in human endothelial cells and enhanced ATP-induced nitric oxide production in spiral ganglion neurons. Steinert et al. reported that the potentiation of Kv2 currents by nitric oxide reduces the excitability of MNTB and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons, indicating a potential role of nitric oxide in the rapid effect of glucocorticoids on neuronal Kv2.2. Interestingly, in the present study, we found that either inhibition of Kv2.2 with antibodies or activation of Kv2.2 by cortisol reduced the firing rate in the pyramidal cortical neurons and presynaptic nerve terminals at the calyx of Held synapses (Fig. 6E–H), suggesting that Kv2.2 plays a key role in fine-tuning the repetitive neuronal firing upon stimulation. Moreover, we observed that cortisol could strongly enhance synaptic depression upon high-frequency stimulation. At calyces, the presynaptic AP firing rate can be 50 Hz in the resting condition and increase to more than 600 Hz upon stimulation. The enhanced inhibition during high-frequency stimulation may provide a certain level of protection for prompt and accurate synaptic transmission."
294,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although the functions of rapid glucocorticoid actions in the brain are not fully understood, one of their main functions is fast feedback regulation of the HPA axis. Glucocorticoids directly suppress HPA activity by rapidly suppressing excitation of the corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), and can also exert positive or negative regulation of the HPA axis through rapid action on the hippocampus or amygdala. Previous studies suggested that glucocorticoid receptors in the prefrontal cortex were involved in the negative feedback regulation of stress-induced HPA activation. The projection of the prefrontal cortex to PVN neuroendocrine cells is through local interneurons, majority of which are GABAergic. Therefore, the inhibitory glucocorticoid action in cortical neurons may be expected to produce fast activation of the HPA axis. However, studies have also shown the presence of local glutamate excitatory synaptic inputs to PVN neurons. In addition, frontal cortex stimulation has been shown to stimulate corticosterone secretion in rats, and local application of glucocorticoids in the medial frontal cortex inhibits stress-induced HPA activation, suggesting that the rapid inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on the actions of prefrontal cortical neurons may provide fast negative feedback regulation of stress-induced HPA activation."
295,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Under non-stress conditions, glucocorticoids are secreted in pulsatile patterns following circadian rhythms, with concentration ranging from tens to hundreds of nanomolars in both rats and mice. However, under stress conditions, peak glucocorticoid levels can reach micromolar levels. Our study revealed that 100 nM of cortisol caused a slight increase in Kv2.2 currents in cultured HEK293 cells, and 1 μM of cortisol significantly increased the Kv2.2 currents by approximately 25%, with the effect peaking at 10 μM. A previous study indicates that the drug concentration at the cell surface is about 3.4 times lower than the perfusion concentration in brain slices. Thus, we used 10 μM cortisol throughout our study, reflecting a physiological dose range."
296,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"A previous study suggested that glucocorticoids could reverse the cochlear acoustic hypersensitivity induced by adrenalectomy and protect from acoustic trauma. In addition, Kv2.2 activity in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body and MNTB of the central auditory brainstem has been implicated in noise-induced hearing loss. These results indicate that the inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on Kv2.2 plays a role in glucocorticoid-induced regulation of hearing."
297,PMC10698577,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, our results demonstrate that glucocorticoids could rapidly facilitate Kv2.2 currents via the membrane-associated glucocorticoid receptors and activation of downstream ERK1/2 signaling pathways, leading to the modulation of neuronal excitability in the pyramidal cortical neurons and calyx of Held synapses. Our study provides the first evidence that glucocorticoids regulate neural activity via a rapid non-genomic effect on Kv2.2 channels."

310,PMC10823497,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Cellular processes rely on proteins with temperature-dependent stability and activity. While thermosensitivity in biological networks is well-explored, the effect of temperature on complex mechanochemical assemblies, like the spindle, is rarely studied. We examined fission yeast spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation from 15⁰C to 40⁰C. Our findings reveal that these parameters follow U-shaped temperature-dependent curves but reach their minima at different temperatures. Specifically, spindle dynamics peak around 35⁰C, whereas chromosome segregation defects are minimized at 25⁰C. This suggests a scenario in which mitotic errors are tolerated to expedite rapid cell cycle progression."

322,PMC10823497,INTRO,title_1,Description
323,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"Temperature can affect cellular functions in a multitude of ways. First, the reaction rate of enzymes is temperature-dependent, with an increase in temperature enhancing the reaction rate. Second, temperature affects the viscosity of cytoplasm; lower temperatures reduce the fluidity of cytoplasm and alter its transport properties. Third, extreme temperature changes can lead to significant rearrangements of protein conformations, such as unfolding or mixing, resulting in substantial behavioural changes. Due to these complex effects, understanding how temperature impacts physiology has remained a topic of interest. Extensive research has been conducted on the biological adaptation of protein function to temperature changes  . These studies suggest that biological systems operate within a narrow ‘optimal’ temperature range, where reaction rates follow Arrhenius law. Beyond this range, protein destabilization necessitates an adaptive response to sustain function. However, it remains unclear whether these principles can be extended to large supramolecular assemblies, such as spindle apparatuses formed during mitosis. In this study, we aim to investigate fission yeast spindle assembly dynamics and chromosome segregation in response to temperatures ranging from 15⁰C to 40⁰C."
324,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"A wild-type fission yeast strain expressing endogenous levels of mCherry- Atb2 (tubulin, microtubule marker) and Hht2 -GFP (histone, DNA marker) were first grown overnight at 25⁰C. Cells were then transferred onto an agarose slide for live-cell imaging using a spinning disk confocal microscope, which was preset to different temperatures: from 15⁰C to 40⁰C, with 5⁰C increments (see Methods). We restricted our study to this temperature range due to two key factors: 1) microtubules are known to depolymerize below 15⁰C in fission yeast (Velve-Casquillas et al., 2011), preventing spindle formation; and 2) cell viability is compromised above 40⁰C  . We allowed approximately 30 minutes for the cells to acclimate to each specific temperature before acquiring images. We observed a linear increase in the frequency of mitosis between 15⁰C and 35⁰C, with the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis per hour rising from approximately 2% to 24% ( Fig. 1A,  1J). However, at 40⁰C, only about 2% of cells underwent mitosis per hour. The linear increase in mitotic frequency can be explained by the temperature-dependent changes in reaction rate kinetics, following Arrhenius law. The low mitotic frequency at 40⁰C is likely due to a heat-shock response, as we did not observe any mitotic cells during the first two hours of observation at this high temperature. Instead, heat-shocked cells continued to grow, resulting in slightly longer cell lengths prior to mitosis ( Fig. 1D )."
325,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"Fission yeast spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation progress through three phases: Phase 1 (prophase), Phase 2 (metaphase/anaphase A), and Phase 3 (anaphase B), each characterized by distinct spindle elongation kinetics and chromosome positions  . At all temperatures, we observed that the majority of cells displayed these three phases in a typical manner ( Fig. 1E,  1K), with the chromosome mass equally separated during anaphase ( Fig. 1B ). We noted that, except at 40⁰C, the rates of spindle elongation for the three phases, especially Phase 3 (anaphase B), exhibited a linear correlation with increasing temperature ( Fig. 1E,  1F, 1K). However, parameters such as cell length at mitosis or final spindle length appeared similar at all temperatures ( Fig. 1D,  1E, 1G, 1K). Thus, while spindle elongation velocity depends on temperature, following Arrhenius law, certain outcomes, such as final spindle length and cell length, are independent of temperature, suggesting that these functional parameters robustly respond to temperature changes to maintain their required functions."
326,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"While the majority of cells behaved as expected of wild-type at different temperatures, we did observe instances of spindle assembly and chromosome segregation defects, particularly at the extremes of temperatures ( Fig. 1C,  1J). We categorized four types of defects: sustained ‘short’ spindle resulting in failed mitosis; spindle ‘breakage’ or collapse resulting in chromosome malposition; ‘lagging DNA’ during anaphase resulting in defective chromosome segregation, and ‘asymmetrical DNA’ at anaphase resulting in unequal chromosome distribution in daughter cells ( Fig. 1C,  1J). We observed that at the low range of temperatures, the short spindle phenotype dominates ( Fig. 1J,  15⁰C); and at the high range of temperatures, the asymmetric DNA phenotype dominates ( Fig. 1J,  40⁰C). This indicates that low and high temperatures have distinct effects on spindle assembly and chromosome segregation: at low temperature, microtubule dynamics and thus spindle assembly may be affected; and at high temperature, kinetochore-microtubule attachment and thus chromosome segregation may be affected. As spindle assembly precedes chromosome segregation, defects occurring during spindle assembly may consequently and additionally affect chromosome segregation ( Fig. 1J,  15⁰C)."
327,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"To better visualize the effect of temperature on spindle assembly dynamics and chromosome segregation, we plotted mitosis duration versus temperature, and mitotic defects (i.e., the combined four types of defects measured) versus temperature ( Fig. 1J ). Both mitosis duration and mitotic defects showed unique U-shaped dependency on temperature ( Fig. 1H,  1I). The U-shaped mitosis duration curve reached its minimum at 35⁰C ( Fig. 1H ). Surprisingly, the U-shaped mitotic error curve showed a minimum at 25⁰C ( Fig. 1I ). These results indicate that the optimal temperature for spindle assembly dynamics is not the same as the optimal temperature for minimizing chromosome segregation defects in fission yeast. We suggest that this reflects a situation where mitotic defects are tolerated to allow for fast cell cycle progression."
328,PMC10823497,INTRO,paragraph,"Mitosis has long been known to exhibit extreme sensitivity to temperature  . Building upon this established observation, our study delves into the intricate relationship between temperature and spindle assembly dynamics and chromosome segregation. Consistent with prior findings  , we also noted temperature-dependent changes in spindle elongation kinetics and mitotic frequency. These discoveries align with the principles of Arrhenius law, which governs reaction rates in biological systems. Notably, our results unveil a delicate equilibrium where specific functional parameters, such as final spindle and cell length, remain remarkably impervious to temperature variations, thus ensuring the robustness of cellular functions. Moreover, our exploration of mitotic defects underscores the complexity of biological responses to temperature extremes, revealing distinct optimal temperature ranges for spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation. This divergence may reflect a tolerance for mitotic defects, even at the risk of cell death, to attain a higher growth rate. Future research in this direction holds the potential to illuminate the broader implications of temperature on cell biology and physiology , particularly for poikilotherm organisms, such as the fission yeast, which cannot regulate their internal temperature, versus homeotherms organisms, which do regulate their body temperature."

351,PMC10910114,TITLE,front,Identification of potential novel proteomic markers of Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes
352,PMC10910114,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Introduction
353,PMC10910114,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogenous cell-derived membrane-bound structures which can be subdivided into three distinct classes according to distinct morphological characteristics, cellular origins, and functions. Small EVs, or exosomes, can be produced by the protozoan parasite Leishmania through the evolutionarily conserved ESCRT pathway, and act as effectors of virulence and drivers of pathogenesis within mammalian hosts. Techniques for the identification of EVs of non-mammalian origin, however, remain inaccurate in comparison to their well-characterized mammalian counterparts. Thus, we still lack reliable and specific markers for Leishmania-derived exosomes, which poses a significant challenge to the field."

356,PMC10910114,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Discussion
357,PMC10910114,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Proteomic data indicated potential novel proteic markers of Leishmania-derived exosomes, including proteins involved in endosomal machinery and the ESCRT pathway, as well as the parasitic phosphatase PRL-1. Further investigation is required to determine the specificity and sensitivity of these markers."
358,PMC10910114,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
359,PMC10910114,INTRO,paragraph,"The trypanosomatid Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to various mammalian hosts through the bloodmeal of the female phlebotomine sandfly. Leishmania infection can lead to various diseases collectively called leishmaniases, for which clinical presentation varies immensely depending on the causative species and host factors. While Cutaneous leishmaniasis usually presents as self-healing cutaneous lesions, parasitic metastasis to the nasopharyngeal mucosal regions causes severe and disfiguring mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The most severe form, visceral leishmaniasis, is characterized by systemic infection and is lethal in nearly all untreated cases. Despite over half the world’s population being at risk of contracting the infection, primarily in low-income countries, leishmaniasis has been classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD) by the World Health Organization due to a significant lack of investment in the research and development of therapeutics."
360,PMC10910114,INTRO,paragraph,"The term extracellular vesicles (EVs) encompasses exosomes, ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies – each of which has a distinct cellular origin, diameter, function, and physical properties. Exosomes – the smallest EVs (30-150 nm) – are of endosomal origin and are ubiquitously produced by eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. They have been shown to play a role in many physiological and pathological functions, including cell-cell communication, immunological responses, renal pathologies, cancer, and infectious diseases, among others. The latter is particularly of interest in the context of leishmaniasis, for which exosomes produced by parasites themselves are involved in immunopathogenesis and are a major determinant of disease outcome."
361,PMC10910114,INTRO,paragraph,"Exosomes are produced by Leishmania spp. in the midgut of the phlebotomine sandfly vector, while parasites are concentrated and packaged into the insect’s infectious inoculum. During the female sandfly’s bloodmeal, leishmanial exosomes are co-egested alongside the parasite into the mammalian host’s skin, immediately exerting effects on surrounding tissues by inhibiting innate immune processes and ultimately exacerbating cutaneous pathology. This process is partially driven by the surface metalloprotease GP63 – a key leishmanial virulence factor which permits motility through the extracellular matrix and abrogates leishmanicidal macrophage function by way of inhibiting oxidative burst, among other roles. Thus, the study of leishmanial exosomes and their role in parasitic survival and virulence is a growing field of study and is essential to understanding the progression of disease."
362,PMC10910114,INTRO,paragraph,"However, the isolation and identification of leishmanial exosomes continue to pose a challenge in the field, as is the case with most EVs of non-mammalian origin. Although markers for mammalian exosomes, such as CD63, CD9, and CD81, have been identified in recent studies, the lack of homologous proteins in Leishmania spp. presents a significant challenge for the precise identification of leishmanial exosomes. Further, while Heat Shock Proteins, particularly HSP83 and HSP70, are used as predictive markers of Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes, they display a lack of specificity to this vesicle class and have been identified across all EV populations, introducing potential error due to misclassification and improper utilization of extracellular vesicles of non-exosomal origin. Herein, we aimed to address this knowledge gap by identifying potential novel biomarkers of leishmanial exosomes through proteomic and bioinformatic studies of all subclasses of EVs, obtaining subpopulations by adapting Kowal et al.’s methodology for serial differential ultracentrifugation of mammalian EVs to protozoa."

367,PMC10910114,METHODS,paragraph,"Methods used to extract L. major extracellular vesicles and perform their fractionation were adapted from Kowal et al. and as previously described by our lab. Modifications to methodology published Kowal et al. were made to account for protozoan rather than mammalian cell culture and relevant centrifugation speeds for Leishmania. Briefly, 800 mL of late log phase (Day 7-9) parasite culture was centrifuged and pelleted at 300 x g (RCF). Parasites were resuspended and washed three times with PBS before being centrifuged and pelleted at 300 x g (RCF) after each washing. The resulting pellet was resuspended in FBS-free RPMI 1640 medium without phenol-red (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 1–4 × 108 parasites/mL, then incubated at 37°C with low agitation (40-60 RPM) in a shaking incubator for 4 hours. Following incubation, the culture was centrifuged at 300 x g (RCF) for 5 minutes to pellet parasites and separate the supernatant from cells. Next, the vesicle-enriched supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 x g (RCF) for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet (2K) was collected and resuspended in exosome buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5), while the supernatant was collected for subsequent centrifugation. Finally, the supernatant was transferred to open-top thin wall polypropylene tubes (16 x 102 mm) and centrifuged at 10,000 x g (RCF) for 30 minutes at 4˚C using a Beckman Coulter Optima XPN-90™ ultracentrifuge and a swing rotor (SW32.Ti). The resulting pellet (10K) was collected and resuspended in an exosome buffer. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 x g (RCF) for 1 hour at 4°C, and the resulting pellet (100K) was resuspended in approximately 250 µL of exosome buffer. All samples were stored at -80°C until further analysis. Protein concentrations of the fractionated samples were determined with a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Scientific; catalog number: 23235). Extraction and fractionation of EV populations was performed in biological triplicates, with each replicate originating from a distinct culture of L. major from experimental procedures performed on different days. All downstream assays were performed on each of the three biological replicates."

382,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To identify potential new markers for Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes, we adapted the methods used by Kowal et al., 2016, whereby preparations of extracellular vesicles (EV) are fractionated into three distinct groups using serial differential ultracentrifugation at 2,000 x g (2K), 10,000 x g (10K) and 100,000 x g (100K) – corresponding to the relative centrifugal forces required to pellet apoptotic bodies, ectosomes and exosomes, respectively. This approach enabled us to isolate the three major classes of EVs produced by the parasite, facilitating the characterization and differentiation of the exosome-enriched fraction (100K) from the other fractions."
383,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To first validate that the fractions corresponded to their respective classes of Leishmania spp.-derived EVs, we performed TEM and NTA to observe distinct morphological characteristics. NTA revealed that the three preparations were composed of EVs with different size distributions, peaks, and curve profiles ( Figure 1 ). The 2K fraction displayed the highest EV diameters, followed by the 10K fraction and the 100K fraction. Furthermore, the 100K fraction contained the highest concentration of vesicles with a diameter from 100-300 nm, indicating an enrichment in small EVs. TEM observations were consistent with the NTA results, revealing that the 2K fraction contained a diverse and heterogenous population of vesicles with large diameters, and that the 10K fraction consisted of intermediate-sized vesicles. The 100K fraction was composed of small EVs, including those with a diameter of 50-150 nm and a cup-shaped double membrane, which are qualities characteristic of exosomes ( Figure 1 ). Together, these data indicate that the 2K, 10K, and 100K extracted fractions are composed of EVs that display characteristic morphological traits of large vesicles (e.g., apoptotic bodies), intermediate-sized vesicles (e.g., ectosomes), and small vesicles (e.g., exosomes), respectively."

386,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"Following the confirmation of distinct morphological traits of the EVs present in each fraction, we conducted a proteomic analysis of the three fractions using LC-MS/MS and a bioinformatic workflow. When mapped to the L. major database, our analysis identified 610 proteins in the 2K fraction, 754 proteins in the 10K fraction, and 568 proteins in the 100K fraction ( Data Sheet 1 ). Of these, the 100K fraction, which contained the highest proportion of small EVs, displayed the highest relative abundance of canonical exosomal markers ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). To further characterize the proteomic landscape of each fraction, we constructed protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of the proteins identified in each EV subgroup using StringDB. The PPI network for the 2K fraction revealed large clusters associated with ribosomal functions, chaperones, and the nucleotide salvage pathways ( Figure 2A ). The 10K network had significant clustering associated with chaperones, signal transduction, tryparedoxin, glycolysis, ribosomal functions, mitochondrial functions, flagellar functions, oxidative phosphorylation, and translation/tRNA pathways ( Figure 2B ). The PPI network for the 100K fraction displayed clusters associated with glycolysis, ribosomal functions, chaperones, and translation/tRNA pathways, as well as unique clusters related to exocytosis and multivesicular body formation ( Figure 2C ). Overall, these networks revealed common and distinct functionalities between the proteomes of the different fractions, such as the mitochondrial pathways in the 10K fraction and exocytosis/MVB Formation in the 100K fraction."

388,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further establish functional differences between the proteomes of each EV fraction, we analyzed the total detected proteins using the PANTHER database for gene ontology – a bioinformatic analysis workflow which classifies and identifies gene products’ functions based on their family and subfamily, molecular function, biological processes, and cellular components. Of note, no significant differences in the percentages of total classified proteins for each subcategory were apparent between the fractions when classified according to biological process and molecular function, despite the total number of identified proteins varying between the samples ( Supplementary Tables 1, 2 ) ( Figures 3A, C ). However, when classified according to cellular components, notable differences between the fractions were observed, suggesting differences in cellular origin between the EV populations (Level 3 - Membrane-bound organelle) ( Supplementary Table 3 ) ( Figure 3B ). The percentage of total protein composition attributed to a mitochondrial origin showed an evident decreasing pattern in the 2K, 10K, and 100K fractions, which were 29.60%, 15.60%, and 7%, respectively, while proteins of vacuolar origin increased from 29.60% to 30.20% and 40.40%, respectively ( Supplementary Table 3 ). We then delved deeper into the proteins of vacuolar origin in each fraction, which are involved in EV biogenesis, and identified several proteins related to the ESCRT pathway in the 100K fraction, notably CHMP2A, CHMP2B, SNF-7, and VTA1. Analysis of the proteomic landscapes of each EV fraction using the PANTHER database revealed their differential cellular origins and underscored a remarkable enrichment of proteins involved in mitochondrial function, vacuolar sorting and the ESCRT pathway in the 100K fractionated EV population. Overall, this analysis indicated that the three fractions comprised different functional elements of varying cellular origins."

Protein-protein interaction networks of enriched proteins were generated using enriched proteins detected by LC-MS/MS in (C) 2K, (D) 10K, and (E) 100K fractions of Leishmania major-derived EVs. Notable protein clusters for each fraction included: (C) Histone Complex, Signal Transduction, Transcription/Ribosomal, and Cellular Respiration in the 2K fraction; (D) no notable clusters in the 10K fraction; and (E) clusters associated to Endoplasmic Glycosylation, Cysteine Pathway, and Vacuolar Sorting/ESCRT pathway in the 100K fraction. Protein-protein interaction networks of the identified proteins were created using String database () using the highest confidence of interaction (>0.900), showing only connected proteins in the network and using an MCL inflation parameter of 3."
392,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further characterize the functionality of such enriched proteins, we used StringDB PPI analysis on the enriched protein sets to generate networks of functional and physical interaction clusters. The network of proteins enriched in the 2K fraction displayed four distinct clusters related to histone complexes, signal transduction, transcription/ribosomal pathways, and cellular respiration. In contrast, no significant interaction networks could be identified for the 10K fraction, likely due to few enriched proteins identified within the fraction ( Figure 4D ). Enriched proteins in the 100K fraction formed three main clusters: endoplasmic glycosylation, cysteine pathway, and vacuolar sorting/ESCRT pathway ( Figures 4C, E ). These data highlight that the proteins enriched in each EV fraction have distinct functional and biological roles, confirming the distinction between the fractionated populations."
393,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"We then compared the quantitative protein expression profiles between the three distinct fractions by generating volcano plots (2K vs. 100K, 2K vs. 10K, and 10K vs. 100K), plotting the fold change of protein expression against the significance of enrichment. Each plot showed a distinct protein expression spread, identifying proteins significantly enriched in each EV fraction. For example, when comparing the 2K and 100K fractions, proteins related to aerobic metabolism, notably citrate synthase and ATP synthase, were significantly enriched within the 2K fraction, whereas important parasitic virulence factors, like EF-1, GP63, and superoxide dismutase, were enriched within the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Furthermore, this same enrichment of parasitic virulence factors in the 100K fraction was observed in comparison to the 10K fraction, with additional enrichment of VPS4, an important component of the ESCRT complex. Additionally, this analysis identified cellular metabolic pathway-related proteins enriched within the 10K fraction as compared to the 100K fraction, particularly enzymes related to glycolysis and the citrate cycle, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ATP-dependent 6-phosphofructokinase, and citrate synthase ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). Finally, when comparing the 2K and 10K fraction proteomes, enrichment of citrate cycle proteins, such as citrate synthase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, was observed in the 2K fraction, while the 10K fraction displayed enrichment of glycolysis-related proteins like enolase and pyruvate kinase ( Supplementary Figure 2 ;  Data Sheet 3 ). In summary, this analysis confirmed our previous observations that each EV fraction has distinct characteristics of protein enrichment and functionality, particularly in cellular aerobic metabolism in both the 2K and 10K fractions and virulence factors and ESCRT pathway proteins in the 100K fraction."
394,PMC10910114,RESULTS,title_2,Classical biomarkers for leishmanial exosome validation are non-specific to small extracellular vesicles
395,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To gain further insight into the characteristics of the Leishmania spp.-derived exoproteome, we conducted a detailed analysis of the key proteins identified, comparing them with established predictive markers such as HSP70, HSP83, GP63, Tryparedoxin peroxidase, Enolase, EF-1, and Surface Antigen Protein, among others. Both HSP83 and HSP70 were identified in all three EV fractions, with similar expression levels. In fact, while HSP70 was slightly upregulated in the 10K fraction, this was not statistically significant. In addition, there was no significant variation in the expression levels of EF-1, Tryparedoxin peroxidase, Calpain-like cysteine peptidase, and 14-3-3 protein between the fractions. GP63, Enolase, and Surface Antigen Protein did, however, show an increasing trend in expression from the 2K to the 100K fraction ( Supplementary Table 4 ). Together, these findings suggest that common predictive markers for Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes are non-specific, though key virulence factors such as GP63 are significantly enriched in populations of smaller leishmanial EVs."
396,PMC10910114,RESULTS,title_2,Proteins involved in the leishmanial ESCRT pathway and the phosphatase system are specific to Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes
397,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"Finally, an in-depth investigation was conducted to identify potential novel markers of Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes. The study focused on the 70, 36, and 32 proteins that were uniquely identified in the 2K, 10K, and 100K EV fractions, respectively ( Figure 5A ;  Supplementary Tables 5–7 ). Notably, the 100K fraction exhibited the presence of SNF-7 and Qc-SNARE proteins, which are both involved in the ESCRT pathway, suggesting their potential as identifying markers. Additionally, 14 proteins were identified in the 100K fraction that were uncharacterized in the UNIPROT database, necessitating further examination. Homology searches conducted on closely related species in UNIPROT allowed for the identification of six homologous proteins involved in the ESCRT pathway: IST1, SNF-7 superfamily, VTA1, CHMP2B, ALIX, and VPS37 ( Supplementary Table 7 )."
398,PMC10910114,FIG,fig_caption,"Fractions of Leishmania major-derived extracellular vesicles display distinct uniquely expressed proteins. (A) The protein content of Leishmania major-derived EVs was catalogued by mass spectrometry (L. major database) using biological triplicates obtained for each fraction (n=3) and analyzed using Mascot followed by Scaffold Software. Total proteins detected by LC-MS/MS in each fraction were determined using inclusion criteria of a minimum of 2 detected peptides, a peptide threshold of 80%, and a protein identity of 95%. Uniqueness was then determined based on a true hit being identified in only one of the fractions. (B) A protein-protein interaction networks of uniquely expressed proteins in the 100K fraction was generated using unique proteins detected by LC-MS/MS in the 100K fraction of Leishmania major-derived EVs. Notable proteins include SNF-7, Qc-SNARE, IST1, SNF-7 superfamily, VTA1, CHMP2B, ALIX, and VPS37 were identified in this group, which are part of the ESCRT pathway, and PP5 and PRL-1 which are parasite phosphatases were also identified. The protein-protein interaction network was created using String database () using the highest confidence of interaction (>0.900), showing only connected proteins in the network and using an MCL inflation parameter of 3."
399,PMC10910114,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further characterize the 32 proteins that were uniquely expressed in the 100K fraction, StringDB analysis was conducted, revealing four protein-protein interaction clusters which could be classified as ESCRT pathway-related (SNF-7 and Qc-SNARE), tRNA-associated, Glucose Transporters, and Parasite Phosphatases (PP5 and PRL-1) ( Figure 5B )."
400,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
401,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Leishmania spp. utilize parasitic virulence factors such as GP63, LPG-1, and EF-1 to drive immunopathology in their mammalian hosts by acting on host immune cells and abrogating leishmanicidal functions. Over the last decade, several research groups have studied the role of leishmanial exosomes in immunopathogenesis, though the lack of specific markers for these extracellular vesicles remains a major challenge in the field."
402,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"For our study, we used serial differential ultracentrifugation as previously described by Kowal et al. to isolate three distinct populations of Leishmania spp.-derived extracellular vesicles – 2K, 10K and 100K fractions – corresponding to large vesicles (e.g., apoptotic bodies), intermediate-sized vesicles (e.g., ectosomes), and small vesicles (e.g., exosomes). While this technique results in the recovery of distinct EV populations with different size distributions, for which the major component is the vesicle class of interest, cross-contamination between fractions is possible due to the heterogenous EV sizes."
403,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Data collected using both TEM and NTA suggested that each fraction contained a distinct extracellular vesicle population, and that the fraction containing small vesicles/exosomes (100K) was composed of relatively homogeneous EVs with a smaller diameter than that observed in other fractions ( Figure 1 ). Direct (TEM) and indirect (NTA) morphological analysis confirmed this, validating our isolation and fractionation methods. These results are in agreement with Kowal et al.’s work on dendritic cell-derived EVs, whereby homogenous EV populations with distinct morphological characteristics were recovered in each fraction, though they recovered larger populations of small EVs (<200 nm). This is likely due to the methodology underlying leishmanial exosome isolation, as a temperature shift is used to stimulate EV production, inducing the packaging of heat shock proteins and large stress-induced cargo. Further, as distributions are similar but slightly shifted towards larger EVs, this finding is a potential artifact of the use of different nanoparticle tracking analysis machinery."
404,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis and downstream bioinformatic mapping of the fractionated EV populations further corroborated the divergence of EV subpopulations in each fraction. Functional characterization with protein-protein interaction analysis (StringDB) indicated that the proteins detected in EV subpopulations had distinct functionality. While mitochondrial proteins formed an important cluster in the 10K fraction, exocytosis and MVB formation associated proteins were unique to the 100K fraction – an observation which validates the origin of the small extracellular vesicles, as these functions are directly related to known pathways for the intracellular formation and outtake of exosomes by eukaryotic cells. However, mitochondrial-related proteins would have been expected in the 2K fraction rather than the 10K fraction, considering apoptotic bodies use mitochondrial pathways for their formation. This finding is likely due to the overlap of intermediate and large-sized vesicles during the isolation process, with potential precipitation of larger vesicles within the 10K fractions or co-precipitation of free mitochondrial fragments along with this fraction. Though this highlights a potential technical limitation of EV isolation, Gene Ontology Analysis (PANTHER-db) revealed an overall decrease of proteins of mitochondrial origin from the 2K fraction to the 10K fraction, indicating that the 2K fraction is the most enriched in apoptotic bodies. Further, proteins of vacuolar origin are most abundant in the 100K fraction, suggesting the presence of exosomes, as their biogenesis requires the formation of vacuoles within multivesicular bodies using the ESCRT pathway. Several proteins involved in this pathway, such as CHMP2A, CHMP2B, SNF-7, and VTA1, which are essential to this process, are uniquely detected within the 100K fractions, validating its composition in small extracellular vesicles with exosome characteristics."
405,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Moreover, quantitative analysis of the proteomes of each fraction enabled the identification of protein sets that were common and enriched in one fraction of EVs or the other. Of notable interest is the inverse relationship between upregulated and downregulated proteins in the 2K and 100K fractions, as visualized heat map, indicating minimal overlap between these protein sets. This not only confirms that minimal contamination by the other class of EVs occurred in the extremum fractions, but also highlights the vastly different roles these EVs play. Further, moderate overlap of the 10K fraction with both the 2K and 10K fraction suggests the presence of low numbers of other EV populations, though a clearly enriched set of proteins indicates relative purity of the preparation. PPI analysis of enriched protein sets permitted the identification of clusters related to the Histone Complex, Signal Transduction, Transcription/Ribosomal, and Cellular Respiration in the 2K complex. In contrast, clusters related to Endoplasmic Glycosylation, the Cysteine Pathway, and the Vacuolar Sorting/ESCRT pathway were identified in the 100K fraction ( Figures 4C, E ). This observation reiterates the importance of the ESCRT pathway in exosome formation within the cell – a pathway that has been experimentally demonstrated by several research groups. Although the association between exosomes and both the endoplasmic glycosylation and cysteine pathways is less clear, these clusters may be due to the importance of the ER and the Golgi apparatus in cargo sorting before packaging and trafficking into exosomes. Further studies are necessary to elucidate a clear link between these two processes and the eukaryotic cell production of small extracellular vesicles."
406,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Though minimal overlap exists between the proteomes of leishmanial EVs and that identified in Kowal et al.’s study of mammalian exosomes, largely due to the absence of homologous proteins across the studied organisms, the overall functionality of the proteomes varies across EV populations in a similar way, as visualized by the step-wise decrease in mitochondrial proteins as EVs decrease in size."
407,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"On the other hand, the volcano plots used to quantitatively analyze protein sets provided evidence of differential protein expression levels among the fractions. The 100K fraction was found to be enriched with key parasitic virulence factors, such as EF-1, GP63, and superoxide dismutase, when compared to both the 2K and 10K fractions. This finding is consistent with previous studies on Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes. Furthermore, glycolysis-related proteins, including enolase and pyruvate kinase, were found to be enriched in both the 2K and 10K fractions, suggesting the presence of EVs associated with aerobic metabolism, such as apoptotic bodies and ectosomes. Thus, it can be concluded that the 100K fraction contains a unique population of EVs, likely of exosomal origin."
408,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Similarly, recent studies on Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes have used markers such as HSP70 and HSP83 and the parasitic virulence factors GP63 and EF-1 to identify this group of EVs. However, both HSP70 and HSP83 were detected in all three EV fractions, indicating that these markers are non-specific. While serial differential ultracentrifugation does not permit the recovery of completely homogenous EV fractions, should this non-specificity be a result of exosomal contamination in other EV fractions, lower abundance of these canonical markers would be expected in larger EV fractions. Thus, the similar abundance of HSP70 and HSP83 across EV populations suggests that this is not an artifact of contamination, but rather the result of the proteins being packaged in all EVs. This finding mirrors data published by Kowal et al., whereby canonical markers of mammalian exosomes are similarly non-specific to small extracellular vesicles."
409,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Levels of GP63, Enolase, and Surface Antigen Protein increased throughout the fractions, with the highest concentration found in the 100K fraction, further suggesting that these EVs are exosomes, which tend which tend to accumulate high concentrations of parasitic virulence factors. Notably, the enrichment in GP63 suggests that the parasite actively uses these vesicles to deliver parasitic proteins into mammalian host immune cells, which have immunomodulatory effects. The abundance of GP63 has also been shown to be highest in exosomes produced by infective metacyclic- and stationary-stage parasites, while exhibiting much lower levels in logarithmic-stage parasites – a finding that further implicates exosome-secreted GP63 in the immunopathogenesis of leishmaniasis. Together, this suggests differential expression of GP63 in a life cycle-dependent manner, and intentional sorting of the surface metalloprotease into exosomal cargo. Additional studies addressing the content of all extracellular vesicle classes at different life stages may provide more insight into this process."
410,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Furthermore, several proteins, including SNF-7, Qc-SNARE, IST1, SNF-7 superfamily, CHMP2B, ALIX, and VPS37, were detected exclusively in the 100K fraction. These proteins play a role in the ESCRT pathway, which is responsible for the endosomal formation and trafficking of small extracellular vesicles, including exosomes. Although these proteins are relatively conserved between species, they have specificity for small extracellular vesicles. Thus, they may be effective markers for identifying Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes, despite the limitations of identifying exosomes of leishmanial origin in a heterogenous mixture of vesicles from different organisms."
411,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Other proteins identified in this study include parasitic phosphatases such as PP5 and PRL-1, which have previously been identified as virulence factors secreted by Leishmania spp. via the exosomal pathway. PRL-1 is a Leishmania-specific protein, and was uniquely detected in the 100K fraction, indicating that it could be used as a marker for identifying leishmanial exosomes. In fact, all PRL-1 homologous proteins indexed in UniProt’s database are expressed exclusively by species of Leishmania, minimizing the risk of cross-identification with other organisms."
412,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, our study utilized a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of small EVs collected through serial differential ultracentrifugation, which was further validated to identify potential proteomic markers of Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes. These include ESCRT proteins SNF-7, Qc-SNARE, IST1, VTA1, CHMP2B, ALIX, and VPS37, as well as the parasitic phosphatase PRL-1. While ESCRT proteins may be conserved between organisms, PRL-1 shows promise as an organism-specific exosome marker and requires further investigation. Further studies are necessary to assess whether these markers are shared by other Leishmania, including species causing visceral and mucocutaneous infection."
413,PMC10910114,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our findings provide valuable insight and advancements in the identification of EVs of non-mammalian origin, challenging the use of certain commonly used markers in the identification of Leishmania spp.-derived extracellular vesicles/exosomes. Moreover, we describe potential new exosome production-related markers (ESCRT-related), like VPS37, and parasite-specific markers like PRL-1, which may enhance the specificity of EV identification or isolation procedures, particularly for Leishmania spp.-derived exosomes (summarized in  Figure 6 ). Follow-up studies to this exploratory work may provide valuable insight into the sensitivity of these markers in immunohistochemistry."

430,PMC11447847,TITLE,front,Multivalent Protein–Nucleic Acid Interactions Probed by Composition-Gradient Multiangle Light Scattering
431,PMC11447847,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Many RNA-binding proteins, such as TDP-43 or CELF1, interact multivalently with nucleic acid repetitive elements. The molecular stoichiometry of protein to nucleic acid is often difficult to assess, particularly by standard electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Here, we investigate the use of composition-gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) for quantifying binding affinity and stoichiometry for two RNA-binding proteins with their nucleic acid partners of varied sequence and length: TDP43’s N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with both TG/GU-repeat ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, and CELF1’s two N-terminal RNA recognition motifs with (TG/UGUU/GU) repeats and an experimentally defined cognate GU-rich element (GRE). Our CG-MALS data derived from each of these interactions is consistent with expected ranges of binding affinity and stoichiometry for proteins binding to shorter nucleic acid repeats. Furthermore, we conclude that CG-MALS can be an excellent method for obtaining quantitative estimates even for high (>2) protein–nucleic acid stoichiometric ratios."
432,PMC11447847,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
433,PMC11447847,INTRO,paragraph,"Multivalent interactions occur universally in biological systems. Many homotypic and heterotypic protein–protein interactions and protein–nucleic acid interactions utilize multivalency to facilitate cooperativity and achieve cellular signaling (e.g., refs (−)). For example, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) such as TDP-43 assemble in multiples upon UG-rich elements of various length, and alterations in the stoichiometric ratios between the protein and its RNA target may have significant consequences regarding normal cellular function. However, current methods still present challenges in providing robust quantitative estimates of the molecular stoichiometry. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), a widely used technique in protein–nucleic acid studies, require optimization of gel conditions to generate distinct bands. Even with optimized conditions, the number of bands is not formally indicative of the correct stoichiometry. Other biophysical techniques, such as fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), or biolayer interferometry (BLI), are indirect methods (i.e., based on changes in fluorescence, enthalpy heat, or “response units” with complex formation). They are generally best suited for quantifying interactions with a 1:1 stoichiometry and can suffer from artifacts for more complex interactions. For example, ITC may not readily distinguish between 1:1 and 2:2 stoichiometric ratios of molecular complexes. In contrast, multiangle static light scattering (MALS) measurements provide a label-free method of directly accessing the molecule’s molar mass, thus directly measuring the essence of complex formation."
434,PMC11447847,INTRO,paragraph,"Composition-gradient multiangle light scattering (CG-MALS) leverages the fact that changes in molar mass can be directly related to the reversible formation and dissociation of specific complexes, each with its own equilibrium association constant. In a typical experiment, each binding partner is prepared in solution at concentrations near the expected equilibrium constant of the interaction. Solutions of varying compositions are prepared automatically, injected into a multiangle light scattering (MALS) detector, and allowed to come to equilibrium inside the MALS flow cell for a user-specified amount of time. The weight-average molar mass (Mw) of the solution is a first-principles calculation based on the light scattering intensity and total concentration of the solution—either specified manually or measured using an inline concentration detector. Association of one species with itself or with a binding partner results in a concentration-dependent increase in Mw; thus, multivalent complex formation is readily evident. The measured Mw as a function of composition is fitted to the appropriate expressions describing the equilibrium association of the analytes, which can include both self-interaction (e.g., dimerization) and heteroassociation. Like AUC or ITC, all interactions occur in solution without the need for immobilization or labeling. CG-MALS can be used to measure interactions with the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) from ∼100 pM to several mM and has been used to quantify a wide variety of biomolecular interactions, including the self-association of insulin, antibody–antigen interactions, and multivalent interactions with complex stoichiometries. The measured stoichiometry and affinity by CG-MALS agree well with other techniques, including SPR, BLI, AUC, ITC, and CryoEM. Although often applied to measuring interactions under dilute solution conditions in the absence of molecular crowding or phase separations, as in this study, CG-MALS can also be applied to high-concentration measurements to understand what drives phase separation and other thermodynamic processes. The automated CG-MALS measurements presented in this study can be applied to interactions among one or two binding partners and can accommodate any combination of self-association and heteroassociation."
435,PMC11447847,INTRO,paragraph,"To explore the utilization of CG-MALS for the analysis of protein–nucleic acid multivalent interactions, we characterized interactions between two proteins and their nucleic acid partners: TDP43RRM1 with (TG)6 and (GT)12 ssDNA and CELF1 with GU-rich elements (GRE) made up of (UGUU)4 and (GU)22 repeats. For each interaction, CG-MALS data were collected in a three-part experiment, as shown in Figure S1: (1) measurement of the protein alone at 3–5 concentrations, (2) measurement of 8–11 mixtures of protein and oligonucleotide at varying concentrations and stoichiometric ratios to assess, and (3) measurement of the oligonucleotide at 3–5 concentrations. Three technical replicates were performed for each interaction. The change in Mw as a function of composition was then fit to an appropriate equilibrium association model to determine the single set of stoichiometries and corresponding equilibrium association constants (Ka) that fit the data."
436,PMC11447847,INTRO,paragraph,"We show that our CG-MALS data is consistent with some of the quantitative binding measurements and observations reported elsewhere. Furthermore, even without detailed data analysis and model fitting, CG-MALS can provide minimum estimates of stoichiometry based on the maximum measured weight-average molar mass (Mw,max) and the molar composition of the protein and nucleic acid components where Mw,max occurs. Complete fitting of CG-MALS data can provide not only quantitation of the complexes formed but also the equilibrium association constant for the formation of each complex and the individual affinity at each binding site (equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd)."
437,PMC11447847,RESULTS,title_1,Results and Discussion
438,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"To evaluate CG-MALS as a method for characterizing multivalent interactions, we chose protein–nucleic acid pairs available to us. To avoid aggregation, we focused on truncated constructs: the first RRM domain of TDP43 (TDP43RRM1) and the first two RRM domains of CELF1 (CELF1RRM1–2). In all cases, at least two proteins are bound to each nucleic acid ligand. For two of the pairs, higher-order binding with four proteins per oligonucleotide was also present. The description and analysis for each of the protein–nucleic acid pair are detailed below."
439,PMC11447847,RESULTS,title_2,TDP43RRM1 Binding (TG)6 or (GT)12 ssDNA
440,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"TDP43 is an RNA-binding protein, consisting of 2 RRM domains that recognize long GU repeats as well as single-strand DNA (ssDNA) TG repeats. For this study, we focus on TDP43RRM1 and assess its interaction with multivalent nucleic acid repeats (TG)6 and (GT)12. Both DNA sequences have been previously reported as TDP43 cognate sequences. TG repeat elements were found near the human CFTR exon 9 gene where TDP-43 can bind and regulate proper splicing activities to avoid exon skipping and ensure correct CFTR protein translation. In other ssDNA studies, TDP43 was demonstrated to form higher-order assemblies (up to four TDP43 RRM1–2) with 24 GT repeats. We set out to test how many domains might bind (TG)6 and (GT)12 sequences and with what affinity, i.e., if two molecules of TDP43RRM1 could bind to (TG)6, we expected four molecules to bind to (GT)12 DNA. EMSA provides qualitative evidence that TDP43 binds to both (TG)6 and (GT)12. For (TG)6, we observe the disappearance of the free ssDNA and the consequent smearing of the lanes with faint bands corresponding to bound states (Figure 1a). Similarly, for (GT)12, we observed binding and the appearance of a major distinct band and a minor more shifted band (Figure 1b). The more pronounced bands for (GT)12 suggest stronger binding and a tighter affinity. However, it is difficult to assess stoichiometry from these results. In contrast, the stoichiometry of the interactions is obvious when they are measured by CG-MALS (Figure 1c,d)."

442,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"Triplicate experiments were performed to investigate each interaction, each one consisting of three gradients, as described in the Materials and Methods section. Each experiment was fit separately, and we present the average and standard deviations of all measured and fit parameters. The measured Mw for each species (Table 1) was in good agreement with the expected monomer molar mass (Table S1). Concentration gradient data for the protein and nucleic acid species alone (i.e., in the absence of the binding partner) revealed no measurable change in Mw for concentrations up to 20 μM for TDP43RRM1, 30 μM for (TG)6, and 3.5 μM for (GT)12, confirming the lack of reversible self-association under the conditions tested. Although the measured Mw was slightly greater than the expected value, it was invariant with the concentration, indicating the presence of a small fraction of irreversible aggregates. Taken together, these results indicate that any change in Mw upon mixing protein and oligonucleotide resulted from the specific, reversible heteroassociation of the two species, and only these complexes were included when fitting the CG-MALS data."
443,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"The heteroassociation gradients, which created 11 different combinations of protein and ssDNA, resulted in an increase in overall weight-average molar mass of the solution and indicated more than one protein bound to each ssDNA (Figure 1c,d). For (TG)6, the maximum measured weight-average molar mass (Mw) occurs when TDP43RRM1 is mixed with (TG)6 at a 2:1 molar ratio, with [TDP43RRM1] ∼ 14 μM and [(GT)6] ∼ 7 μM (Figure 1c), suggesting a 2:1 stoichiometry. The maximum Mw of 21.0 ± 1.8 kDa was consistent with two proteins bound to each oligonucleotide (Figure 1c), and this measured value was 40% higher than the Mw that would result in the absence of an interaction upon mixing these analytes at the same concentration (Figure 1c, gray dashed line). The best fit considers two binding sites with an equivalent affinity. Fitting three experiments independently resulted in an average equilibrium dissociation constant at each binding site of Kd = 10.4 ± 3.2 μM (Table 1). The concentrations of the complexes formed as a function of composition are shown in Figure 1e. Similar studies (TDP43RRM1 with sequence (GT)6) by ITC reported tighter affinities with Kd ∼ 100 nM for protein binding to the first site and Kd ∼ 10 nM to the second site, suggesting cooperativity between sites. The discrepancies could be attributed to the differences in sequence and experimental conditions. The ITC experiments were performed with lower buffer and salt concentrations (15 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 25 mM KCl) versus our buffer conditions (25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, pH 7.3). Also, since the CG-MALS experiments were conducted at concentrations from 3 to 30 μM (TG)6 and most of the protein-oligonucleotide mixtures were made in conditions of excess (TG)6 (Figure 1c,e), higher affinity interactions may have been masked, and the effect of cooperativity may have been negligible."
444,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"For (GT)12, the measured Mw suggests higher-order binding and higher affinity compared to the interaction with (TG)6. Even at ∼10 times lower overall concentrations of oligonucleotides (i.e., concentrations up to 3.5 μM (GT)12 compared to concentrations up to 30 μM (GT)6), a significant increase in Mw is observed, reflecting both the increase in affinity and stoichiometry. The maximum measured Mw of 46.3 ± 1.9 occurs where [TDP43RRM1] = 4[(GT)12] = 8.3 μM (Figure 1d) and is significantly higher than the maximum possible Mw that could be achieved if each (GT)12 bound only two TDP43RRM1 at these concentrations (39 kDa), as shown by the green alternative nonfitting model in Figure 1d. Thus, the best fit is unambiguously consistent with four equivalent binding sites each with Kd = 1.34 ± 0.12 μM (Figure 1d, blue line), confirming a higher affinity for TDP43RRM1 as compared to (TG)6. The concentrations of each complex formed are shown in Figure 1f. Since the light scattering intensity measured by MALS is proportional to the weight-average molar mass, even a small amount of high-molecular-weight species can significantly impact the data, giving high confidence to the observation of the 4:1 species even at relative concentrations of 10% mol/mol or less. The RSD <10% on the Kd across three technical replicates further increases confidence in the fit."

446,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"CELF1 is also an RNA-binding protein, consisting of 3 RRM domains with the N-terminal RRMs (RRM1 and RRM2) separated from the C-terminal RRM3 via a long disordered linker. For the current studies, we focused on CELF1RRM1–2 and its interactions with its defined GU-rich target elements (GREs). Similar to the investigation of TDP43-binding ssDNA, we observed significant differences in both the stoichiometry and affinity for CELF1RRM1–2 depending on the length of the ssRNA binding partner. Similarly, we observed no significant self-association of either CELF1RRM1–2 or its binding partners."
447,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"Initially, we investigated CELF1RRM1–2 binding to (UGUU)4. As expected, EMSA showed disappearance of free ssRNA and appearance of smeary band(s) that migrate higher upon increasing protein concentration but without clear insight into the stoichiometry. Triplicate CG-MALS experiments were performed to assess the interaction. In all three experiments, the maximum Mw (∼30 kDa) was achieved when the concentration of protein was approximately twice the concentration of ssRNA (overall mole fraction of CELF1RRM1–2 = [CELF1]/([CELF1]+[(UGUU)4]) ∼ 0.67), consistent with a 2:1 stoichiometry (Figure 2b). The best fit, considering all three experiments together, suggested two nonequivalent binding sites. CELF1RRM1–2 binds strongly at the first site with Kd ∼ 0.02 μM and more weakly to the second site with Kd ∼ 4 μM (Table 1). The results presented consider a single global fit to all three experiments. Significant experiment-to-experiment variation was observed, as seen in Figure 2b, likely due to the presence of aggregates in CELF1RRM1–2. Although CG-MALS confirmed an overall 2:1 stoichiometry for this interaction, the current data were insufficient to conclude whether the two binding sites are equivalent or nonequivalent, as shown by the comparison of the blue best fit line and the green alternative fit line in Figure 2b. However, a binding model considering two nonequivalent binding sites is consistent with literature studies, suggesting that the secondary site could accommodate only 1 RRM domain, resulting in a weaker affinity, and thus is presented as the best fit."

Importantly, the interaction appears to occur at lower concentrations of CELF1, compared with (UGUU)4, suggesting a higher affinity interaction (Figure 3a). With CG-MALS, we can fully quantify this interaction. The maximum measured Mw (86.1 ± 1.2 kDa) suggests that we can see the formation of at least a 4:1 stoichiometric CELF1RRM1–2:(GU)22 complex (Figure 3b). The best fit included the formation of three species with the following protein:ssRNA stoichiometry: 1:1, 2:1, and 4:1 (Table 1).

451,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1:1 and 2:1 complexes appear to form with equivalent affinity at each binding site (Kd = 1.0 ± 0.2 nM), which is over 1000× stronger than the affinity for CELFRRM1–2 for (UGUU)4. This might reflect an increase in cooperative binding affinities as expected for multivalent interactions. Under these conditions, a 4:1 complex also appears, and the third and fourth binding events were assumed to have equivalent affinity (Kd = 390 ± 30 nM). In general, we would also expect to observe the formation of the 3:1 complex; however, the model excluded the formation of this species, possibly due to the high concentration at which the measurements were performed (Figure 3c). It is possible that the 3:1 complex would also be evident at lower concentrations closer to Kd, where more binding sites would be unsaturated."
452,PMC11447847,RESULTS,paragraph,"In conclusion, we show that CG-MALS is an excellent technique for obtaining estimates of binding affinities and molecular stoichiometry associated with multivalent interactions. Even when the binding interactions become significantly more complex and involve high stoichiometric ratios (>2), the Mw,max can provide minimum estimates of molecular stoichiometric ratios. Better quantitative estimates can be obtained with CG-MALS data simulations and estimated Kd values from experimental studies for both simple stoichiometry (≤2) and complex interactions by combining data across multiple concentration ranges. Thus, CG-MALS could be a useful technique in investigating the molecular stoichiometry involved in large multivalent protein–nucleic acid complexes. The multivalent interactions of these transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins with nucleic acid repeat sequences are required for their cellular functions. CELF1 is linked to myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1 disease associated with the toxic effect of (CUG)n expansion. TDP-43 aberrant aggregation with RNA has been linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) disease. There might be critical protein:RNA stoichiometry thresholds that may distinguish between physiological and pathological complexes and could benefit from the CG-MALS technique."

483,PMC11463412,TITLE,front,Challenges and advances for huntingtin detection in cerebrospinal fluid: in support of relative quantification
484,PMC11463412,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Huntington disease (HD) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a glutamine-coding CAG tract in the huntingtin (HTT) gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats resulting in expression of mutant HTT (mHTT). A promising treatment approach being tested in clinical trials is HTT lowering, which aims to reduce levels of the mHTT protein. Target engagement of these therapies in the brain are inferred using antibody-based assays to measure mHTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is frequently reported as absolute mHTT concentration based on a monomeric protein standard used to generate a standard curve. However, patient biofluids are a complex milieu of different mHTT protein species, suggesting that absolute quantitation is challenging, and a single, recombinant protein standard may not be sufficient to interpret assay signal as molar mHTT concentration. In this study, we used immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry (IP-FCM) to investigate different factors that influence mHTT detection assay signal. Our results show that HTT protein fragmentation, protein-protein interactions, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length affect assay signal intensity, indicating that absolute HTT quantitation in heterogeneous biological samples is not possible with current technologies using a single standard protein. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 anti-polyglutamine antibody, commonly used in these assays as a mHTT-selective reagent and demonstrate that mHTT binding is preferred but not specific. Furthermore, we find that MW1 depletion is not only incomplete, leaving residual mHTT, but also non-specific, resulting in pull down of some wildtype HTT protein. Based on these observations, we recommend that mHTT detection assays report only relative mHTT quantitation using normalized arbitrary units of assay signal intensity, rather than molar concentrations, in the assessment of central nervous system HTT lowering in ongoing clinical and preclinical studies, and that MW1-depletion not be used a method for quantifying wildtype HTT protein."
485,PMC11463412,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
486,PMC11463412,INTRO,paragraph,"Huntington disease (HD) is a devastating, inherited neurodegenerative disease with progressive cognitive, psychological and physical symptoms. HD is caused by expansion of the CAG repeat tract in exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene above a critical threshold of ~35 repeats, resulting in expression of a polyglutamine (polyQ) expanded form of the HTT protein, referred to as mutant HTT (mHTT). HTT plays important roles in proteostasis, axonal transport, transcription regulation, cellular stress responses, and mitochondrial function and the expression of mHTT is considered responsible for the molecular pathogenesis cascade, including both loss of function and gain of toxic function, resulting in HD phenotypes in HD animal models and patients. However, despite being a monogenic disorder, the mechanisms of HD pathophysiology are complex, and remain the subject of intense study."
487,PMC11463412,INTRO,paragraph,"The majority of candidate therapies currently being tested in clinical trials for HD aim to lower levels of the mHTT protein. To infer target-engagement of these drugs, mHTT levels, usually from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are monitored using ultrasensitive detection assays. Decreased mHTT levels in HD model mouse brain following intracerebroventricular administration of HTT-targeting antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) were shown to induce correlative mHTT lowering in CSF, validating CSF mHTT quantitation as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for HTT lowering clinical trials. mHTT is also a monitoring biomarker for HD, and its levels track with proximity to disease onset as well as cognitive and motor deficits. Numerous different mHTT detection assays have been developed to date, all of which employ capture-probe antibody pairs, one which is used to immunoprecipitate and the other is used for detection of mHTT for biofluid samples. Moreover, a single full-length mHTT protein standard is often used to determine a molar concentration of mHTT from assay signal."
488,PMC11463412,INTRO,paragraph,"mHTT exists in many different proteoforms including alternatively spliced fragments, proteolytically cleaved fragments, in complexes with a myriad of binding partners and with different polyQ tract lengths generated via somatic expansion mechanisms. However, our current understanding of the relative distribution of these proteoforms in biofluids and other samples from people with HD or HD animal models, or how they track with disease, remains limited."
489,PMC11463412,INTRO,paragraph,"One limitation of mHTT detection immunoassays is the inherent bias in which specific proteoforms are detected, which is defined by the epitopes of the antibody pair that are used. Different antibody pairs will preferentially detect different proteoforms of mHTT and no one pair of antibodies can detect all or “total” HTT in the complex milieu of species that exists in biological samples given the fragmentation and variety of conformations of this protein. Additionally, the commonly used MW1 antibody, which was raised against the DRPLA-19Q/GST fusion protein, binds polyQ expanded proteins, and can form stoichiometrically heterogenous interactions with mHTT species. This suggests that polyQ length functions as an additional variable for detection assay signal, in addition to mHTT concentration. Indeed, the variable stoichiometry of MW1-mHTT polyQ interactions compared to other anti-HTT antibodies likely accounts for the so-called detection paradox where mHTT concentration exceeds total HTT concentration. This paradox suggests that absolute quantitation of mHTT may not be possible with immunoassays with a single protein standard across an array of patient samples where CAG number, and hence polyQ length, is variable, and that defining molar concentrations of mHTT by such a methodology may be misleading."
490,PMC11463412,INTRO,paragraph,"In this study, we set out to explore different factors which can influence mHTT detection assay signal using a suite of HTT proteins, including a comprehensive allelic series of full-length HTT samples, spanning wildtype to juvenile HD polyQ tract lengths. Employing an IP-FCM assay, as well as other immunoassay approaches, we show that a variety of mHTT properties and assay condition considerations influence assay signal and show that using a single protein standard across an array of biological samples is not sufficient to allow accurate calculation of mHTT concentration. We also explore the binding specificity of the MW1 antibody and demonstrate that detection of polyQ expanded mHTT is preferential but not specific. Together these data support a new paradigm for mHTT detection, where results are reported as relative quantitation in reference to a given standard protein rather than reporting absolute concentrations. Moreover, that MW1-depletion should not be used to quantify wildtype HTT protein."

493,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Previously, we designed and developed an open-source toolkit for the eukaryotic expression and purification of full-length HTT proteins with different polyQ tract lengths and N- or C-terminal FLAG tags for purification and/or detection. This toolkit is a unique resource for HD research as it encompasses a fine-grain allelic series of HTT proteins corresponding to wildtype control (Q23, Q25, Q30), HD threshold inflection point (Q36), adult-onset HD (Q42, Q52, Q54) and juvenile-onset HD (Q60, Q66). Regardless of polyQ tract length, all proteins can be co-expressed with HAP40, an important interaction partner of HTT whose levels track with HTT in cells and which functions to stabilize the large HTT protein molecule."
494,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"All HTT proteins were purified from insect cells using a two-step protocol, FLAG-affinity chromatography and gel filtration, and verified by SDS-PAGE (Supplementary Figure 1). We have previously validated HTT and HTT-HAP40 samples produced using this toolkit with numerous biophysical and structural methodologies to show they are pure, monodisperse, folded and functional samples amenable to downstream interrogation. We further complemented this suite of HTT proteins with mHTT fragment proteins described previously, to ensure better coverage of the milieu of mHTT species which are present in patient and HD animal model biofluid samples. The fragment proteins included a construct spanning aa. 1-171 with Q68 fused to aa. 1744-2234, hereafter called fusion HTT Q68, and aa. 1-586 with Q68, hereafter called N586 HTT Q68."

496,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"To measure the signal elicited from our panel of HTT proteins under different conditions, we used a micro-bead-based immunoprecipitation-flow cytometry (IP-FCM) assay. This assay was previously optimized, and a capture-probe antibody pair were identified which permit ultrasensitive detection of mHTT in HD mouse model and patient CSF (Figure 1A). Our IP-FCM assay employs the HDB4E10 antibody (hereafter HDB4), which was raised against an epitope within the bridge domain aa. 1844-2131 of HTT and also recognizes an epitope in exon 1 (Supplementary Figure 2), and the polyQ-specific MW1 antibody which is employed in other published mHTT detection assays. Assay signal from our HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay and a different ultrasensitive mHTT detection assay also suitable for use in CSF that employs Singulex technology, showed statistically significant correlation of mHTT assay signal (Figure 1B)."
497,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Analysis of a titration of our allelic series of purified full-length HTT samples using the IP-FCM assay reveals that assay signal is modulated by polyQ length as well as concentration, with greater assay signal measured for higher protein concentrations and longer polyQ tract lengths (Figure 2A). Replotting these data as a function of polyQ tract length shows that the relationship between polyQ length and assay signal at a defined protein concentration is approximately linear under the conditions tested (Figure 2B)."
498,PMC11463412,RESULTS,title_2,Different structural properties of the HTT protein can influence IP-FCM assay signal
499,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we investigated how different structural features of the HTT protein might influence HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay signal. Beyond polyQ tract length, HTT proteoform heterogeneity in HD patient CSF is expected due to alternatively spliced fragments, or fragmentation due to proteolytic cleavage, as well as aggregation of the protein into higher order oligomers. Recombinant proteins used as standards can also differ by the position of their purification tags which can further modulate their structure and/or conformation. Using a suite of HTT proteins, we investigated these variables."
500,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Firstly, full-length and fragment HTT proteins bearing approximately the same polyQ tract were assessed using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay, revealing significantly different profiles for each protein over equivalent concentration titrations (Figure 3A). Despite all three proteins containing approximately the same polyQ-tract length, the assay signal is influenced by the context of these epitopes with the greatest signal observed in the full-length protein, potentially due to conformational flexibility and/or other structural changes that different epitope flanking sequences confer to the protein molecule."
501,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we assessed full-length HTT proteins, with either N- or C-terminal FLAG tags and polyQ tract lengths of Q23 or Q66 using the HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay (Figure 3B). For HTT Q66, proteins bearing a C-terminal FLAG tag compared to an N-terminal FLAG tag show lower assay signal. A similar trend is also seen for HTT Q23 at higher concentrations of protein, with N-terminally tagged HTT Q23 eliciting higher assay signal that C-terminally tagged HTT Q23. This finding suggests that affinity tag positioning can alter the accessibility or conformation of antibody epitopes. Indeed, the MW1 epitope begins just 17 residues after the N-terminal tag and flanking sequence composition is known to influence the biophysical properties of the polyQ tract."
502,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"We then looked at the effects of HTT protein oligomerization and aggregation on IP-FCM assay signal. The gel filtration elution profile of apo HTT has a distinct shape, reported by multiple groups. The main peak corresponding to monomeric HTT eluting after ~0.6 column volumes preceded by dimer, tetramer and increasingly higher order oligomer peaks eluting ahead of the monomer peak, with the largest oligomers and aggregates eluting in the column void volume (~0.3 column volumes). FLAG-affinity chromatography purified HTT Q54 (~85% pure) was concentrated (input) (Figure 3C, middle) and applied to Superose6 Increase 10/300 column, then we collected eight 1 mL fractions spanning all peaks (fractions 1-8) (Figure 3C, left). The concentration of the eight gel filtration fractions and input sample was normalised and then samples of each analysed by HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM assay at different dilutions (Figure 3C, right). Fractions corresponding to mHTT monomer yielded the lowest signal in this assay (F6-8), with signal increasing as oligomeric state increased to the largest assemblies (F1). The change in assay signal with oligomeric state might reflect avidity effects occurring in higher order assemblies of HTT protein, where adjacent epitopes across protein molecules are more likely to be in closer proximity, as is reported for other aggregate protein immunoassays."
503,PMC11463412,RESULTS,title_2,IP-FCM assay buffer can influence assay signal for some HTT protein complexes
504,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"HTT is a protein scaffold and is reported to bind more than 500 proteins. Because of the varying interaction interfaces and conformational changes induced by complex formation, we hypothesised that different protein complexes of HTT are likely to have altered epitope availability. HAP40 is the only structurally validated interaction partner of HTT and can bind HTT with either wildtype (Q23) or disease expanded (Q54) polyQ tract lengths. Assay buffer components, such as detergents, can influence protein complex structure and stability. Performing our IP-FCM assay with a buffer more closely resembling physiological conditions, such as artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (Figure 4A), a difference in assay signal can be observed for apo compared to HAP40-bound forms of HTT for the Q54 form of the protein (p<0.0001 for all concentrations, 2way ANOVA multiple comparisons of log-log data) but not Q23, indicating that expanded exon 1 might be differently structured in these two proteoforms of HTT. However, when the assay is performed under more stringent buffer conditions, such as with the detergent NP-40 (1% (v/v/)) (Figure 4B), this difference in signal is lost. This could be due to NP-40-mediated disruption of the HTT-HAP40 complex itself or conformational uniformity of exon 1 structure for apo and HAP40-bound HTT in the presence of detergent."
505,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we compared the assay signal obtained from human CSF samples diluted 1:1 in either aCSF or a buffer containing NP-40 detergent (Figure 4C). Although samples with relatively low assay signal gave comparable signal in both buffer conditions, as shown by their proximity to the X=Y line, those with higher mHTT concentration as denoted by higher assay signal showed much higher signal in NP-40 buffer compared to aCSF. Again, this indicates that detergent in assay buffer can modulate epitope availability and binding by the HDB4/MW1 antibody pair in the IP-FCM assay format, perhaps related to changes in HTT complex formation, conformation or structure under different buffer conditions."
506,PMC11463412,RESULTS,title_2,MW1 has preference but not specificity for mHTT and can deplete wildtype HTT
507,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"The MW1 antibody is also used to pretreat samples for analysis in ultrasensitive wildtype HTT detection assays, with the aim of depleting biofluid samples of mHTT, leaving only wildtype HTT to be detected with polyQ length-independent immunoassay antibody pair. However, our HTT allelic series IP-FCM data (Figure 2) show that MW1 has only preference, not specificity for mHTT, suggesting that such an assay approach may also deplete wildtype HTT. This corroborates previously studies which drew the same conclusion."
508,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"We conducted a parallel experiment with Hu97/18 mouse CSF depleted using MW1 and assessed the depleted CSF and MW1 IP fraction using HDB4/MW1 IP-FCM. The depleted CSF shows reduced signal in the assay compared to the sample obtained by MW1 IP (Figure 5B). This finding confirms that MW1 binds both HTT Q18 and Q97 in this experiment, and binding preference, but not complete specificity is shown by MW1 to mHTT. The degree to which each form of HTT is depleted from a biofluid samples likely depends on the relative affinity of MW1 for the specific polyQ tract lengths of the HTT proteins in question, as well as avidity effects, which will be driven by the relative concentrations of the proteins and the MW1 antibody in the depletion experiment conditions."
509,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"To test this hypothesis, we first used MW1 in an immunoprecipitation (IP) experiment with Hu97/18 HD model mouse brain lysates. Hu97/18 mice express full-length human HTT Q97 and Q18 and lack mouse Hdh (Figure 5A). Analysis of the input, flow through and IP fraction using a western blot that separates wildtype and mHTT bands, shows that the mHTT protein is diminished in the flow through fraction compared to input, though not completely depleted, and that both forms of the protein are present in the elution."
510,PMC11463412,RESULTS,title_2,The affinity of MW1 for HTT is influenced by polyQ length
511,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further investigate MW1 binding to our full-length HTT allelic series, we used two orthogonal assays to measure MW1 interaction with different polyQ length HTT proteins. MW1-HTT binding was analysed under native and denatured conditions using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis respectively. For ELISA, HTT was adhered to the plate surface and a titration of MW1 antibody was incubated prior to detection with HRP-linked secondary antibody as previously described. The MW1 titration was optimised to ensure binding saturation as seen by stabilised A450 readings as MW1 concentration increases (Figure 6A). This permitted calculation of binding affinities of MW1 for each HTT protein, reported as apparent KD values (Kapp)(Figure 6B), as the stoichiometry of binding complex for each polyQ tract length is unknown and varies as a function of the levels of HTT immobilised on the plate surface. In this assay, A450 values change as a function of MW1 concentration and polyQ tract length. This finding parallels our earlier observations of small Q-length changes influencing immunoassay signal in our IP-FCM analysis (Figure 2). We observe that Kapp decreases exponentially with polyQ tract length indicating increasingly high affinity binding to longer polyQ tract length HTT proteins. This indicates that, in solution, MW1 binds HTT in a polyQ tract length dependent manner, as others have shown before, but also highlights how MW1 only has preference for mHTT and is not specific for HTT species with polyQ tracts above the disease threshold length."
512,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"To understand if this finding for MW1-epitope interaction is specific to HTT, we next investigated another polyQ tract containing protein, ataxin-3. Using two different polyQ length ataxin-3 proteins, we repeated the ELISA protocol with ataxin-3 Q10 or Q80 adhered to the plate this time. We observe the same pattern for these two proteins with A450 maximal signal greatly increased for Q80 vs Q10 and the calculated Kapp values much lower for Q80 than Q10, indicating much tighter binding (Supplementary Figure 3)."
513,PMC11463412,RESULTS,paragraph,"In our western blot analysis of the full-length HTT allelic series, approximately equal amounts of each HTT protein were analysed by western blot, probing with MW1 and also EPR5526, a polyQ independent antibody which targets another region of the exon 1 sequence. Similar to our ELISA experiments, we observed polyQ tract length dependent binding of MW1 (Figure 6C) with only faint bands observed for HTT proteins with wildtype polyQ tract lengths. Calculating the normalised signal ratio of MW1/EPR5526, we observe an inflection point ~Q36 with stabilised signal ratio for HTT proteins with polyQ tract >42. Together, this further validates our conclusion that MW1 interaction with HTT is polyQ length driven but not specific for mHTT (Figure 6D)."
514,PMC11463412,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
515,PMC11463412,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In this study we show that mHTT ultrasensitive detection assay signal is dependent on many factors beyond protein concentration, including fragmentation, protein-protein interaction, affinity tag positioning, oligomerization and polyglutamine tract length. Additionally, we demonstrate that MW1 has preference but not specificity for mHTT and can bind wildtype HTT, albeit with reduced affinity compared to disease-range polyQ tract length proteoforms of mHTT."
516,PMC11463412,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Biological fluid samples from HD animal models and patients, such as CSF, contain a heterogenous mix of mHTT and wildtype HTT species, including fragments and oligomeric assemblies, subsets of which could be detected with different antibody pairs in ultrasensitive immunoassays. However, to absolutely quantify mHTT, wildtype HTT or total HTT, many different antibody pairs and protein standards would have to be used and interpreting overlapping signals in these assays to absolutely define the precise mHTT proteoform composition in a sample would be very challenging. Another caveat in capturing different HTT proteoforms in immunoassays it that HTT antibody generation has been historically focused on targeting the N-terminal region of the protein, especially epitopes within the exon 1 region of the protein. It is possible that C-terminal fragments of HTT that arise from different proteolytic cleavage events are still not accounted for with the antibodies currently used in these assays. HTT is a protein scaffold in both its wildtype and disease forms, forming complex 3D structural assemblies of multi-protein complexes. Whether any of the interactions are maintained for extracellular HTT in different biofluid samples is unclear. This is an important consideration for HTT detection assays as some HTT protein-protein interactions almost certainly shield or occlude HTT antibody-epitope binding and thus alter assay signal. We demonstrate that buffer conditions of different stringency can alter assay signal arising from apo HTT compared to HTT in complex with HAP40. Ensuring all proteoforms are detected would be critical for absolute determination of “total” HTT protein levels, which cannot be achieved with current technology."
517,PMC11463412,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our data demonstrate that mHTT detection assay signal is influenced by polyQ tract length, corroborating the findings of others. MW1 interaction with HTT is dependent on the polyQ tract length, showing preference but not specificity for disease-length polyQ tracts for both the denatured and native full-length HTT protein. This finding means that even measuring a single form or fragment of mHTT in a cohort of patient samples would be very difficult given the variation of polyQ tract length between individuals and even within a single patient sample due to variation over the disease course which arises due to somatic expansion. This mismatch in polyQ tract length protein standards and biological samples accounts for the mHTT detection paradox where mHTT levels exceed total HTT quantified in a single sample due to vastly different antibody-protein stoichiometry and therefore assay signal between antibody pairs used to detect HTT. This finding is applicable to other polyQ containing proteins where polyQ tract expansion also occurs during disease as we demonstrate with our analysis of wildtype and SCA3 representative ataxin-3 proteins."
518,PMC11463412,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Even with these caveats in mind, ultrasensitive HTT detection assays still have an important role to play in our evaluation of HTT as a biomarker of HD, and for assessment of target engagement of HTT-lowering therapeutics. We propose the recommendations laid out in Box 1, which advocate for relative quantitation of HTT to be reported by such assays rather than reporting HTT protein concentration, and that mHTT depletion assays are reconsidered as an approach to measure wildtype HTT. Relative reporting of assay data will also allow data interoperability and comparison across different clinical and preclinical studies."

568,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Background
569,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Prolonged neonatal exposure to hyperoxia is associated with high mortality, leukocyte influx in airspaces, and impaired alveolarization. Inhibitors of type 4 phosphodiesterases are potent anti-inflammatory drugs now proposed for lung disorders. The current study was undertaken to determine the effects of the prototypal phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor rolipram on alveolar development and on hyperoxia-induced lung injury."
570,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Methodology/Findings
571,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Rat pups were placed under hyperoxia (FiO2>95%) or room air from birth, and received rolipram or its diluent daily until sacrifice. Mortality rate, weight gain and parameters of lung morphometry were recorded on day 10. Differential cell count and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage and cytokine mRNA levels in whole lung were recorded on day 6."
572,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Rolipram diminished weight gain either under air or hyperoxia. Hyperoxia induced huge mortality rate reaching 70% at day 10, which was prevented by rolipram. Leukocyte influx in bronchoalveolar lavage under hyperoxia was significantly diminished by rolipram. Hyperoxia increased transcript and protein levels of IL-6, MCP1, and osteopontin; rolipram inhibited the increase of these proteins. Alveolarization was impaired by hyperoxia and was not restored by rolipram. Under room air, rolipram-treated pups had significant decrease of Radial Alveolar Count."
573,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Conclusions
574,PMC2563688,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Although inhibition of phosphodiesterases 4 prevented mortality and lung inflammation induced by hyperoxia, it had no effect on alveolarization impairment, which might be accounted for by the aggressiveness of the model. The less complex structure of immature lungs of rolipram-treated pups as compared with diluent-treated pups under room air may be explained by the profound effect of PDE4 inhibition on weight gain that interfered with normal alveolarization."
575,PMC2563688,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
576,PMC2563688,INTRO,paragraph,"Despite recent major advances in perinatal care, very premature infants remain prone to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease. BPD is mainly related to an arrest of lung development, characterized by minimal capillary development and fewer enlarged alveoli. Treatments to prevent or alleviate BPD are limited, and no currently available therapy addresses unequivocally these unmet medical needs. New therapeutic strategies are therefore necessary to maintain harmonious alveolar development and prevent BPD."
577,PMC2563688,INTRO,paragraph,"Alveolarization and distal pulmonary vascular development are intricate events that are affected by a number of insults, including prenatal or postnatal infections, inspired oxygen fraction, and mechanical ventilation. A final common pathway for many of these insults is initiation and persistence of inflammation in immature lungs. Increased concentrations of cytokines and leukemoid reaction have been detected in amniotic fluid and tracheal aspirate from newborns who subsequently developed BPD. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils invade airspaces within hours after birth and persist during the first weeks of life in the airways of these infants. Animal studies have demonstrated that neutrophil-induced airway inflammation promotes an arrest of alveolarization, and that inhibiting the neutrophil influx preserves alveolar development in hyperoxia-exposed newborn rats, an experimental model of BPD."
578,PMC2563688,INTRO,paragraph,"Elevated cAMP level suppresses the activity of immune, inflammatory, and epithelial lung cells and inhibits airway remodeling. cAMP is metabolized by cyclic nucleotides phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Among the eleven families of PDEs, the PDE4 family represents the major cAMP-metabolizing enzymes in all immunocompetent cells. PDE4 inhibitors are active in a broad spectrum of pulmonary inflammation models and are considered as novel anti-inflammatory drugs in lung disorders."
579,PMC2563688,INTRO,paragraph,"We therefore hypothesized that inhibition of PDE4 could prevent inflammation and hence the subsequent alveolarization impairement, and potentially oxygen-induced mortality. We used the hyperoxia model of BPD to test this hypothesis. We investigated the effect of the PDE4 selective inhibitor rolipram on airway inflammation, mortality rate, weight gain, and the extent of alveolarization assessed by morphometric methods. Inflammation was evaluated on day 6, a time when inflammation is important in this model, and assessed by differential cell count and cytokines levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue. Alveolarization occurs between day 4 and day 14 in rat, and so is better evaluated in the second week of life. Due to very high mortality rate in our model, we chose to study it no later than day 10."
580,PMC2563688,INTRO,paragraph,"This issue has already been explored recently by de Visser and colleagues who found that PDE4 inhibitor therapy prolonged median survival of hyperoxia-exposed pups, reduced alveolar fibrin deposition, lung inflammation as evaluated by albumin content in BAL and macrophage count in histological studies. However, possible direct effect of PDE4 inhibition on alveolar development was not evaluated in this study since no data were provided for pups treated with rolipram under room air. The present study confirms partly their data, but indicates that PDE4 inhibition presents, of its own, inhibiting effects on alveolarization."

611,PMC2563688,RESULTS,paragraph,"Lung volume: overall, lung volume and specific lung volume were different among all groups (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively, by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). Hyperoxia decreased lung volume in pups treated by rolipram as well as in those receiving the diluent (p<0.05 for each by Mann-Whitney U test), but did not alter specific lung volume. Rolipram had no effect on absolute lung volume, but increased specific lung volume (p<0.01) either under hyperoxia or air (p<0.01)."
612,PMC2563688,RESULTS,paragraph,"Alveolar surface: overall, alveolar-surface density, absolute and specific alveolar-surface areas were significantly different among all groups (p<0.001 for both by Kruskall-Wallis analysis). As expected, hyperoxia decreased drastically the alveolar surface density by 33%, as well as the absolute and specific surface areas by 44% and 37%, respectively (p<0.01 for rolipram- and diluent-treated pups). Rolipram had no effect on alveolar-surface area density but decreased absolute alveolar-surface area in air-exposed pups by 17% (p<0.05) and by 22%, in O2-exposed pups, although this effect did not reach significance (p = 0.06). Rolipram increased specific alveolar-surface area by 20% in air-exposed pups (p<0.01), and by 22% in those under hyperoxia (p<0.05) as compared to O2-diluent group, but this value remained lower than in groups under air (p<0.05)."
613,PMC2563688,RESULTS,paragraph,"Parenchymal alveolar volume: overall, the differences were not significant for volume density but were significant for absolute and specific values between groups (p<0.05 and p<0.001, respectively). Absolute values were decreased by hyperoxia in both diluent (by 19%) and rolipram groups (by 14%) (p<0.05 for each), but rolipram had by itself no effect on absolute volume, neither in air nor under hyperoxia. Hyperoxia altered specific parenchymal volume neither in rolipram nor in diluent groups. Rolipram increased specific values under hyperoxia by 38% and in air by 49% (p<0.01 for each)."
614,PMC2563688,RESULTS,paragraph,"Radial alveolar count (RAC): overall, differences were significant for RAC among groups (p<0.01).

Rolipram decreased RAC in air-exposed pups by 35% (p<0.01), but induced no further change in hyperoxia-exposed pups."
615,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
616,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In the present study, we report that inhibition of PDE4s by rolipram in rat pups exposed to hyperoxia improved survival, decreased lung inflammation as assessed by inflammatory cell count in airspaces and cytokine measurement, but did not prevent hyperoxia-induced impairment of alveolarization. Most importantly, we evidence that rolipram presented by itself deleterious effects in normoxia, including decreased weight gain and defective alveolarization, which had not yet been reported."
617,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Similar to our previous study, we studied inflammation at day 6 and alveolarization and mortality at day 10. The choice of day 6 for assessing inflammation is based on the demonstration by Deng et al.  that inflammation, as evaluated by accumulation of inflammatory cells in BAL, begins rapidly after initiating hyperoxic exposure and increases with the duration of exposure with a marked significant increase at day 6. Therefore, choosing this stage allowed accurate evaluation of inflammation and its inhibition to be performed at a time when mortality was not yet extensive. Because on the one hand alveolar septation occurs between day 4 and day 14 in the rat pup, and is therefore already patent on day 10, and on the other hand mortality became excessive beyond day 10, this stage was chosen to evaluate mortality rate and perform lung morphometric analysis."
618,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Prolonged survival of rat pups under hyperoxia has previously been described with pentoxyfiline (PTX), a nonselective inhibitor of PDEs, and more recently with rolipram at a concentration lower than that used herein, as well as with an other PDE4 selective inhibitor, piclamilast. By contrast, PTX treatment did not prolong survival in adult rats after exposure to 95% oxygen. This may be explained by the difference in tolerance to oxygen between neonatal and adult animals. Rolipram is the prototypal PDE4 selective inhibitor, first described more than three decades ago, and it is generally admitted that at the dosage used in this study, rolipram has minimal inhibitory effect on other PDE families and does not interfere with unrelated signalling pathways. A new generation of selective PDE4 inhibitors that includes piclamilast has been developed, with progress mainly in pharmacokinetics, albeit they reproduce with constancy the previously described in vitro and in vivo effects of rolipram. Thereby, results observed with PTX or piclamilast are certainly related to the capacity of these molecules to inhibit PDE4s. It should be pointed out that de Visser et al. reported, as the result of a pilot experiment, a mortality rate of 33% for pups under hyperoxia and treated with rolipram 0.5 mg/kg/d, whereas we observed decreased mortality under hyperoxia with this dose. The choice of the latter in the present study is based on our preliminary observations that pups in room air presented high mortality rate with higher doses of rolipram, whereas minimal systemic PDE4 inhibition was achieved at doses below 0.5 mg/kg/d. Strain differences in susceptibility to oxygen and rolipram as well as those in initial weight may account for differences in findings between investigations. We indeed observed that rolipram-induced mortality was higher in thinnest pups. Since in the previous investigation, pups were about 2 grams lighter than those in our study on day 1, this represents a likely explanation of the different mortality rates between them."
619,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The precise mechanisms by which PDE4 inhibition confers protection against lethal hyperoxia are still unclear. The role of PDE4s in the response to hyperoxia has been poorly studied. It has been demonstrated that hyperoxia, as well as hypoxia, increased blood level of PDEs especially in young rats, but this was not correlated to mortality. We found a tendency towards higher PDE4 activity levels after hyperoxia for 6 days in lung tissue homogenates, and reported an increase of a 72 kDa PDE4B protein, presumably PDE4B2. PDE4A and PDE4D isoforms were not modified by hyperoxia. Because PDE4 activity is high and PDE4B2 is constitutively expressed in neutrophils, this may be related to the lung influx and sequestration of neutrophils induced by hyperoxia in the first week of life. PDE4 has been implicated in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells, their chemotaxis, and the production of oxidative burst. In this view, the fact that we documented here a significant decrease in neutrophil count in BAL from rolipram-treated pups associated with a significant decrease of PDE4 activity suggests a specific role for PDE4 in oxygen toxicity. Oxygen insult drives a chronic inflammation involving free radicals, arachidonic acid metabolites, cytokines, chemokines, and recruitment and activation of neutrophils with a further production of reactive substances that react rapidly with proteins, carbohydrates and lipids, thus disrupting intercellular and intracellular homeostasis. The drastic decrease of neutrophil sequestration in airspaces consecutive to rolipram treatment may thus account for its advantage for survival."
620,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although we did not address directly the question of oxidative stress, we determined the protein level in BAL and mRNA level in tissue of the key pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine MCP-1 and IL-6 to document airway inflammation. These two mediators have been shown to be elevated during hyperoxia, and neutralization of MCP-1 alleviated lung oxidant injury. Rolipram treatment decreased significantly the accumulation of these proteins in BAL, although it did not diminish the increase of their mRNAs. This latter finding is discrepant with the study by de Visser and collaborators who showed significant decrease of MCP-1 and IL-6 mRNAs on day 10 of exposure. Differences in timing of PDE4 inhibition between their and our experiments may explain this difference. The fact that these mediators were affected by rolipram only at the protein level might reflect the contribution of neutrophils and rapid turnover of these proteins with absence of accumulation in lungs. Indeed, several investigations demonstrated though a significant PDE4-inhibition effect at the transcriptional level in leukocytes, whereas alveolar epithelial cells concomitantly expressed cytokine mRNAs that may be poorly controlled by PDE4s in these cells."
621,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In addition, we also determined OPN at pre- and post translational levels and showed a significant effect of rolipram on both. OPN, a secreted phosphoprotein, exists both as an immobilized ECM molecule in mineralized tissues and as a cytokine that mediates cellular functions involved in inflammation and ECM remodelling. OPN gene expression is low during secondary septation, a key event of alveolarization, increases afterwards, and is overexpressed during neonatal hyperoxia and in pulmonary fibrosis, the latter being a feature encountered to variable extent in BPD. Thus, PDE4 inhibition exhibits a potent anti-inflammatory effect in early postnatal period, which is consistent with other models of inflammation in the adult and with clinical trials."
622,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Considering the role of inflammation in the development of BPD, we therefore expected a preventive effect of rolipram on hyperoxia-induced lung injury, including its effects on alveolar development. Consistent with previous experiments using the same approach, alveolarization was impaired by hyperoxia, including a significant decrease in alveolar-surface area and RAC. This was the case, however, for diluent-treated as well as for rolipram-treated pups, indicating that rolipram did not restore alveolar surface area and RAC to control values. In their former study, de Visser and coworkers argued for a beneficial effect of PDE4 inhibitors on lung histopathology because they found decreases in septal thickness and alveolar edema despite an absence of effect of PDE4 inhibitors on changes induced by hyperoxia in mean linear intercept. However, our more in-depth morphometric study together with the study of direct effects or rolipram in pups maintained in room air lead to modulate this interpretation. Indeed, rolipram also induced by itself a decrease of absolute alveolar-surface area and RAC in pups maintained in air. This appears suggestive of altered lung development, although this conclusion must be moderated by the observation that all specific values, i.e. when reported to body weight, were increased. Nonetheless, defective alveolarization induced by hyperoxia was not further impaired by rolipram. Neither area and volume densities, nor absolute values and RAC were significantly diminished in rolipram-treated pups under hyperoxia as compared with hyperoxia alone. It is likely that if there were pups presenting more extensively altered alveolarization, they could not survive further and were thus not evaluated."
623,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"A major gross side effect that was encountered with rolipram treatment was a significant decrease of weight gain, which is probably responsible for at least a part of altered alveolarization. Whereas pups maintained under hyperoxia showed a significant reduction of body weight gain after 5 days only as compared with those in normoxia, rolipram reduced weight gain already from the first day of injection, and its effect encompassed that of hyperoxia. This effect of rolipram was also observed, although to a lesser extent, by de Visser et al.  with half the dose used herein, even though they did not report data from a group treated with rolipram in room air. Our data allow us to conclude unequivocally to a significant effect of PDE4 inhibition independent of oxygen exposure. Rolipram may have an adverse effects on food intake most likely because of its adverse effects in the central nervous system and parietal glands that account for nausea, vomiting, and enhanced gastric acid secretion. However, conversely to the previous study, we did observe pups nursing properly and gastric milk filling during the whole course of rolipram treatment (data not shown). Toxicological reports during preclinical studies of PDE4 inhibitors demonstrated significant inflammation of the intestinal tract and mesenteric vascularitis that suggest ill-absorption of food. Clinical studies with rolipram did not report weight loss in adult patients, the main adverse effects being headache, nausea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and vomiting, but it should be emphasized that the effects of PDE4 inhibitors are unknown on an unborn child, a pregnant woman, or a nursing infant. PDE4D knock-out mice, but not PDE4B or PDE4A knock-out strains, present growth retardation during their first weeks of life, catching up later in adulthood. A clinical trial evaluating the effect of caffeine, which has nonselective PDE inhibitory properties and is widely used in neonatal intensive care units for preventing apnea of prematurity, induced a significant weight gain reduction in these infants, although the difference was no longer present at two years of life. Taken together, these observations suggest that PDE4 inhibitors may indeed interfere with statural growth in the early days of life."
624,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In fact, impaired weight gain in rolipram-exposed pups seems to be the major factor accounting for our lung morphometric results. Massaro et al.  previously described a decrease in lung volume and absolute alveolar surface area with increased specific values in undernourished pups. The importance of nutrition in alveolar formation is known even in adult mice, and the rapid onset of genes involved in alveolar formation following refeeding after caloric restriction has been highlighted recently. Therefore, it is difficult to dissociate the effect of rolipram on alveolarization from its weight-gain altering effect, although the decrease of RAC that directly reflects deficient alveolar septation argues for an additional effect independent from that on overall growth."
625,PMC2563688,DISCUSS,paragraph,"To conclude, PDE4 inhibition by rolipram displayed a potent inhibiting effect on hyperoxia-induced lung inflammation and mortality, but the direct inhibiting effects of the molecule on rat pup growth and lung development do not allow one to conclude favourably about its possible protective effect towards impaired lung alveolarization. Due to this side effects, it is certainly too early to propose a therapeutic role of PDE4 inhibition in the prevention of altered lung development. Nevertheless, the model of altered lung development used here is extremely aggressive, and the part of oxidant injury and inflammatory response cannot really be distinguished. Therefore, studying PDE4 inhibition in other models of arrested alveolarization, more purely inflammatory, as well as the use of a local instead of a systemic route should be considered. Moreover, the possible involvement of PDE4s in lung development is completely unknown and requires specific studies."

655,PMC2577208,TITLE,front,Proteomics Identification of Nuclear Ran GTPase as an Inhibitor of Human VRK1 and VRK2 (Vaccinia-related Kinase) Activities*S⃞
656,PMC2577208,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Human vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) 1 is a novel serine-threonine kinase that regulates several transcription factors, nuclear envelope assembly, and chromatin condensation and is also required for cell cycle progression. The regulation of this kinase family is unknown. Mass spectrometry has permitted the identification of Ran as an interacting and regulatory protein of the VRK serine-threonine kinase activities. The stable interaction has been validated by pulldown of endogenous proteins as well as by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. The three members of the VRK family stably interact with Ran, and the interaction was not affected by the bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP. The interaction was stronger with the RanT24N that is locked in its inactive conformation and cannot bind nucleotides. None of the kinases phosphorylated Ran or RCC1. VRK1 does not directly interact with RCC1, but if Ran is present they can be isolated as a complex. The main effect of the interaction of inactive RanGDP with VRK1 is the inhibition of its kinase activity, which was detected by a reduction in VRK1 autophosphorylation and a reduction in phosphorylation of histone H3 in residues Thr-3 and Ser-10. The kinase activity inhibition can be relieved by the interaction with the constitutively active RanGTP or RanL43E, which locks Ran in its GTP-bound active conformation. In this complex, the interaction with VRK proteins does not alter the effect of its guanine exchange factor, RCC1. Ran is a novel negative regulator of nuclear VRK1 and VRK2 kinase activity, which may vary in different subcellular localizations generating an asymmetric intracellular distribution of kinase activity depending on local protein interactions."
657,PMC2577208,INTRO,paragraph,"Since completion of the human kinome, a new subfamily of serine-threonine kinases, known as vaccinia-related kinases (VRKs),1 has been identified that is composed of three proteins, two of which are catalytically active, VRK1 and VRK2, and are mainly expressed in proliferating cells. These proteins have a conserved kinase domain but differ in their regulatory region with little conservation among them or with any other protein. The VRK1 protein is mostly nuclear, although in some cell types it is also present in the cytosol; this subcellular localization is regulated in response to a specific signal.2 The VRK2 gene codes for two isoforms. The cytosolic VRK2A isoform corresponds to the full length and has 507 amino acids, and its carboxyl-terminal region has a hydrophobic tail and is membrane-bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The VRK2B isoform is shorter; corresponds to the first 397 amino acids of isoform A, thus lacking the membrane-anchoring region; and has both a cytosolic and nuclear localization; the latter is mainly expressed in cell types in which the VRK1 protein is cytosolic, thus suggesting a functional replacement."
658,PMC2577208,INTRO,paragraph,"Human VRK1 is the best characterized protein; it phosphorylates several transcription factors related with cellular responses to stress such as p53, forming an autoregulatory circuit; c-Jun; and ATF2. VRK1 also phosphorylates Baf, a protein implicated in the assembly of nuclear envelope membranes and in the formation of a functional mitotic spindle. Recently VRK1 has been shown to phosphorylate histone H3 in Thr-3 and Ser-10 residues and is implicated in chromatin condensation. VRK1 expression has been correlated with several proliferation markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. VRK1 expression parallels that of c-myc and c-fos and occurs early in the G1 phase. The phenotype induced by inactivation of VRK1 induces defective cell proliferation and eventually cell death, suggesting that VRK1 can participate at some stage in these processes."
659,PMC2577208,INTRO,paragraph,"Cell-specific biological effects are determined by the interplay among signaling pathways in the cells, which are likely to be determined by the proteins expressed, their interactions, and their levels in each cell type, but most intracellular protein-protein interactions remain to be identified. For the identification of these interactions the use of proteomics approaches represents a powerful tool that can identify protein networks as well as placing the proteins within signaling pathways related with different biological processes. Furthermore the characteristics of specific protein-protein interactions can also result in the identification of novel protein motifs that can be used to identify new components of protein networks in the cell. Elucidation of the components of a signaling pathway requires the identification of specific protein-protein interactions, which may be either consecutive steps in the pathway or regulatory elements."
660,PMC2577208,INTRO,paragraph,"The components of the signaling pathway where VRK1 is implicated, or other VRK members, are little known, therefore we decided to search for interacting proteins using a proteomics-based approach. The nuclear Ran GTPase was identified in this study by proteomics analysis as a partner of VRK proteins. The small GTPases are a family of signaling proteins of which the most characterized members are the Ras, Rho, and Rac proteins, all of which are cytosolic and mediate signals that reach mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. There is also a nuclear small GTPase, Ran, that belongs to the Ras superfamily; its partners in the nuclei are mostly unknown except for importin proteins that are implicated in nuclear transport, which is the best well established function of Ran. However, Ran is also implicated in regulation of kinetochore function and formation of a functional mitotic spindle. The active RanGTP is necessary to form membrane vesicles that are precursors required for the assembly of the nuclear envelope. The only guanine exchange factor known for Ran is RCC1. Ran participates in chromosome segregation by its interaction with RCC1. RCC1 generates a local concentration of RanGTP that is necessary for activation of proteins required for kinetochore assembly, spindle formation, or nuclear envelope formation among other mitotic events. Nuclear envelop reformation depends in its early stages on RanGTP. Ran can also activate the mitotic kinase Aurora A. In addition, its GEF, RCC1, is regulated by phosphorylation in mitosis preventing Ran binding to importin and turning it to chromosome binding."
661,PMC2577208,INTRO,paragraph,"In this work the nuclear Ran GTPase was identified as a modulator of VRK activity on itself or on histone H3, an effect that depends on the activation state of Ran. However, VRK1 did not affect the nucleotide-bound state of Ran. Thus, this Ran interaction with VRK proteins might regulate their kinase activity spatially and temporally in the cell, thus contributing to determining different roles depending on its subcellular localization and representing a functional compartmentalization."

To stop the reaction, samples were added to 2 ml of stop buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) and immediately filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). The filters were washed with 20 ml of stop buffer, transferred to vials, and dissolved with 1 ml of 2-methoxyethanol (Sigma). Radioactivity that remained bound to the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the results are shown as mean values with error bars indicating the S.E. For GTP binding assays, the same protocol was performed with the following variations: GST-Ran was loaded with 0.1 μmol of unlabeled GDP, and 0.007 μm (0.35 μl of) free 35S-GTP (GE Healthcare SJ-1320) was used for exchange in each reaction. The incorporated radioactivity was measured at the indicated times in the figures."

688,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Identification of Ran as a Partner of VRK2B and VRK1 by Mass Spectrometry—
689,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To identify proteins that interact with members of the human VRK protein family an approach based on the use of a biochemical copurification of complexes using the GST affinity tag coupled with protein identification using mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was followed (Fig 1A). For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with mammalian plasmids expressing fusion proteins GST-VRK1 or GST-VRK2B (the nuclear isoform of VRK2) that are identical and differ only in the last amino acid and with the empty vector expressing GST. The correct expression of the transfected proteins was confirmed in an immunoblot analysis (Fig 1B, left, and supplemental Fig S1A, left). Cell extracts were used for a pulldown of associated proteins using as control GST versus GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were separated by isoelectrofocusing followed by an electrophoresis in the second dimension. SYPRO Ruby staining allowed the detection of several different spots pulled down with GST-VRK2B or GST-VRK1 but not with control GST that may correspond to proteins specifically bound to VRK proteins. In both cases, a ∼25-kDa spot was excised from gels for MS identification (Fig. 1B, right and supplemental Fig S1A, right). The analysis of the MALDI-TOF spectrum in each case showed several tryptic peptide masses that matched to theoretical masses from the Ran GTPase sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P62826) (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1B). For the spot from the VRK2B pulldown, 12 of the 21 mass values searched matched with Ran, spanning 39% of the protein sequence (Fig. 1D) with a score of 170. For the spot from the VRK1 pulldown, 15 of the 23 mass values matched with Ran, covering 59% of the full-length protein (supplemental Fig. S1C) with a score of 229. Sequences corresponding to each tryptic peptide are shown (Fig. 1C, right, and supplemental Fig S1C). These data indicate that the protein selectively bound to VRK2B or VRK1 is Ran, the only known nuclear GTPase. These results suggested that Ran can interact with several members of the VRK family."
690,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,In Vitro Interaction of the Three Human VRK Proteins with GST-Ran—
691,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further confirm that all human VRK proteins or their isoforms were able to interact with Ran, in vitro pulldown experiments were performed. The HEK293T cell line was transfected with plasmids expressing either VRK1 or VRK2B and also VRK2A or VRK3. Cell extracts from transfected cells were used for a pulldown with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing either bacterially expressed GST-Ran or its mutants, GST-RanT24N that has a non-active conformation and mimics the GDP-bound state or RanL43E that mimics the GTP-bound active conformation and does not hydrolyze GTP. The GST-Ran proteins were used to bring down associated proteins that were detected in immunoblots with an anti-HA antibody specific for the HA epitope tag used in VRK proteins. The three GST-Ran proteins, wild type and both mutants, but not the GST control, were able to stably interact with VRK1 (Fig. 2A), VRK2B (Fig. 2B), VRK2A (Fig. 2C), and VRK3 (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the three human VRK proteins are able to interact with human Ran protein."
692,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next whether VRK1 binding to Ran was concentration-dependent was tested. For this aim an in vitro interaction assay was performed using a non-limiting concentration of GST-Ran protein (80 nm) and increasing concentrations of VRK1 protein. The VRK1 bound to Ran was identified in an in vitro pulldown assay followed by an immunoblot. As the amount of VRK1-His increased so did the amount bound to GST-Ran (Fig. 2E), indicating that this interaction is direct and does not require any additional protein."
693,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Because the nucleotide loading of Ran might affect its interactions with other proteins such as VRK1, this in vitro interaction was also determined after loading Ran with either GDP or GTP to try to determine whether there were differences based on the bound nucleotide. GST-Ran and His-VRK1 were incubated in vitro under different conditions regarding the presence of nucleotide or EDTA. VRK1 was detected in the pulldown independently of the nucleotide present (Fig. 2F, the first two lanes with wild-type Ran), although it appeared to be stronger in the case of the inactive GST-RanT24N (Fig. 2F)."
694,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Interaction of Endogenous VRK1 with GST-Ran—
695,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Endogenous VRK1 protein is expressed at significant levels in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A, top gel). Therefore extracts of this cell line were incubated with GST-Ran beads and used for a pulldown assay. The GST-Ran protein (Fig. 3A, left lane), but not the negative control GST (Fig. 3A, right lane), was able to specifically interact with human VRK1. Next to determine whether the conformation of Ran could significantly alter the interaction, a similar assay was performed using three different Ran proteins in the pulldown assay. The three Ran proteins, wild type, RanL43E and RanT24N mutants, were able to interact and brought down the endogenous VRK1 protein (Fig. 3B)."
696,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To confirm this result, a reciprocal experiment was performed to determine whether the endogenous Ran protein was also able to interact with transfected VRK1. For this aim HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid pCEFL-GST-VRK1, and the expressed fusion GST-VRK1 protein was used for a pulldown experiment. In the lysate the expression of transfected proteins as well as endogenous Ran and its interacting protein RCC1 were determined (Fig. 3C, top). In the pulldown Ran was clearly detected in the corresponding immunoblot in which RCC1 was also present in this complex (Fig. 3C, bottom). To rule out that RCC1 does not directly interact with VRK1, a similar experiment was performed in which exogenous RCC1 was transfected (plasmid pGFP-RCC1) to displace endogenous RCC1 from the complex. This exogenous GFP-RCC1 protein did not displace the endogenous RCC1 from Ran, but it did compete with VRK1 for some of Ran because a smaller amount of Ran was detected bound to VRK1, and no GFP-RCC1 could be detected bound to VRK1 in the pulldown (Fig. 3D)."
697,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Subcellular Localization of Endogenous VRK1 and Ran Proteins and Detection of Their Interaction by Reciprocal Immunoprecipitation—
698,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"As an initial step, whether the two proteins, VRK1 and Ran, were at least partially colocalized within the cell was determined. The endogenous VRK1 and Ran proteins were detected by confocal immunofluorescence in HEK293T (Fig. 4A) and HeLa (not shown) cell lines. VRK1, detected with the polyclonal antibody VE1, was mostly localized in the nucleus, and some was localized in the cytosol. Ran was mostly cytosolic with some nuclear aggregation. Both proteins presented some overlap of their signals both in nucleus and cytosol in interphase (Fig. 4A). In cells that have finished cell division, Ran was mostly located on, or near, the nuclear membrane, but its overlap with VRK1 was intranuclear (Fig. 4B)."
699,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To validate the interaction detected between Ran and VRK1, a reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. The expression of the VRK1 and Ran proteins was first checked in the cell lysate (Fig. 4C, top gel). This extract was used for immunoprecipitation of Ran (Fig. 4C, bottom left) or VRK1 protein (Fig. 4C, bottom right). In each case a parallel immunoprecipitation with an antibody of the same isotype without an endogenous target was performed as negative control. VRK1 was detected in the Ran immunoprecipitate but not in the control with a nonspecific (anti-AU5) antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom left). Next the inverse experiment was performed, endogenous VRK1 was immunoprecipitated, and the Ran protein was detected in this specific immunoprecipitate but not in the case of the control with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 4C, bottom right). As a positive control, a parallel experiment was performed to check whether RCC1 was also detected as bound to immunoprecipitated Ran following the same experimental conditions used to see the interaction of VRK1 with immunoprecipitated Ran (Fig. 4D)."
700,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Because VRK1 and VRK2 have a high conservation in their first 396 amino acids, whether there was an overlap between Ran and VRK2 was also tested. In the case of the endogenous VRK2 proteins the antibody cannot discriminate between its two isoforms because the sequence of isoform B corresponds to the first 397 amino acids of isoform A; therefore the signal has to be distributed in the cytosol and some in nuclei. In HEK293T cells there was a strong overlap between the cytosolic signal of VRK2 and Ran (Fig. 4E), suggesting that they might also be forming a complex in this compartment."
701,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Identification of the VRK1 Region Interacting with Ran—
702,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To identify the region of the VRK1 molecule required for the interaction with Ran, a pulldown with three different constructs of VRK1 as targets of GST-Ran was performed. The VRK1 regions were the full length (amino acids 1–396), amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–332), and carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 267–396) as well as the kinase-dead VRK1(K179E). The full length interacted very well, but there was a significant loss of binding with either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal region of VRK1, suggesting that they are much less efficient (Fig. 5A). These two constructs have an overlapping region corresponding to residues 267–332 (Fig. 5B). The interaction with kinase-dead VRK1 was also weaker probably because of the instability of this inactive protein that lacks autophosphorylation. VRK2B is almost identical in size and structure to VRK1 and thus behaved in a similar manner (not shown). A similar experiment was performed using fusion proteins spanning different regions of VRK2 expressed from plasmids pCEFL-GST-VRK2N (1–320), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C1 (256–508), pCEFL-GST-VRK2A-C2 (364–508), and pCEFL-GST-VRK2B-C (256–397). In VRK2 the overlapping region corresponds to residues 256–320 (Fig. 5, C and D). These regions in both VRK1 and VRK2 have a very flexible structure that can adapt alternative conformations, particularly when truncated at one end of the protein as these protein constructs are. The interaction of RanL43E with VRK1 occurs through the same region as that in Ran because both behave in a similar way (Fig. 5E). Also the conservation of the interaction region in the three VRK proteins suggests that they might compete with each other, as well as with other Ran-binding proteins containing the same motif, for binding to Ran. This was tested using VRK3, which was able to partially compete with VRK1 for the interaction with Ran (Fig. 5F)."
703,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,RCC1 and VRK1 Can Bind Simultaneously to Ran—
704,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"The data available indicate that Ran is able to bind to its GEF, the RCC1 protein, and to VRK1 (this work); therefore it is possible that both proteins can bind simultaneously to Ran. First whether VRK1 could bind to RCC1 was determined in a pulldown assay. The GST-VRK1 protein was unable to bring down the RCC1 protein by itself (Fig. 6A) indicating that they do not appear to interact directly even if VRK1 is in a molar excess over RCC1."
705,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"It is possible that when Ran is bound to RCC1 the formation of this complex might increase Ran affinity for its interaction partner VRK1. Thus when the Ran-RCC1 complex is formed there might be a change in conformation of Ran that increases its binding to VRK1 without displacing RCC1. If that interpretation is correct, in an experiment in which Ran and VRK1 were equimolar, the binding to VRK1 was determined as the amount of RCC1 was increased. In this case the VRK1 bound to Ran increased as the amount of RCC1 was raised (Fig. 6B). A similar result was also obtained when using a molar excess of Ran (not shown). These results indicate that the binding of Ran to RCC1 facilitates the incorporation of VRK1 into the complex."
706,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Ran and RCC1 Are Not Phosphorylated by VRK1 or VRK2B—
707,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Because VRK1 and VRK2B proteins have kinase activity, whether Ran was also a phosphorylation target of these kinases was tested. For this aim an in vitro kinase assay was performed using GST-VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S2A) or GST-VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S2B), and as substrates Ran, RanT24N, and RanL43E proteins were used. The autophosphorylation of VRK2B and VRK1 was used as positive controls. VRK2B and VRK1 did not phosphorylate any of the Ran proteins, but the positive control of kinase autophosphorylation was clearly detected."
708,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Ran is regulated by its interaction with its GEF factor, RCC1. RCC1 is regulated by phosphorylation in serine residues that inhibits its binding to importin and promotes its association required for spindle assembly. Therefore, the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 might be possible, and this was tested using a panel of RCC1 phosphorylation mutants in an in vitro kinase assay (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The same result was obtained with VRK2B (supplemental Fig. S3C).This phosphorylation was studied with and without the inclusion of different Ran mutants, but none of them were able to induce the phosphorylation of RCC1 by VRK1 (supplemental Fig. S3D). Therefore it can be concluded that VRK1 does not phosphorylate RCC1."
709,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Ran Down-regulates the Kinase Activity of VRK1 and VRK2B on Autophosphorylation and on Phosphorylation of Histone H3—
710,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Regulation of kinase activities is an alternative possibility resulting from a protein-protein interaction. The interaction between Ran and VRK1 might regulate the kinase activity of the latter. Therefore whether the kinase activity of VRK1 was affected by its interaction with Ran and whether it was dependent on any of the different forms of Ran were tested. For this aim two alternative assays were performed, autophosphorylation of VRK1 and phosphorylation of histone H3 in Ser-3 and Thr-10 by VRK1. Initially whether VRK1 autophosphorylation or H3 phosphorylation was affected by any of the different forms of Ran was determined. The kinetics of phosphorylation reaction is much faster than complex formation; therefore Ran and VRK1 were preincubated to form a complex before performing the kinase assay. VRK1 was able to autophosphorylate itself and phosphorylate H3, but these phosphorylations were inhibited by either wild-type Ran or the inactive RanT24N, whereas H3 was phosphorylated in the presence of the active RanL43E (Fig. 7A). Because RanL43E is able to stably bind GTP, the assay was also performed in its presence, but the result was similar to that without GTP (not shown)."
711,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next a dose-dependent phosphorylation of H3 by VRK1 was performed in an in vitro kinase assay, and at the higher VRK1 dose, Ran was added at different concentrations. Autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation were dependent on the amount of VRK1 (Fig. 7B). The addition of increasing amounts of Ran inhibited both VRK1 autophosphorylation and H3 phosphorylation. The inhibition of phosphorylation was dependent on the amount of Ran present in the assay (Fig. 7B)."
712,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"To determine whether a similar situation could be detected with the endogenous VRK1 kinase an experiment was performed in which the endogenous VRK1 protein was immunoprecipitated from either non-synchronized cells or cells blocked with nocodazole in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In the case of cells blocked in mitosis, there was an increase in autophosphorylation of VRK1 (Fig. 7C) as well as an increase in H3 phosphorylation, and both were inhibited by the inclusion of Ran protein in the assay (Fig. 7C, last two lanes)."
713,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"It has been reported that VRK1 phosphorylates histone H3 in Thr-3 and Ser-10. Therefore, whether these two residues were indeed phosphorylated by VRK1 was tested. The residues were detected using phosphospecific antibodies for each residue. An in vitro kinase assay was performed in the absence or presence of Ran (individual reaction components are shown in Fig. 7D, top), and the products were analyzed with the antibodies. VRK1 clearly phosphorylated H3 in Thr-3, which was reduced in the presence of Ran (Fig. 7D, bottom); however, the phosphorylation in Ser-10 was less noticeable because this antibody was much less efficient, although the phosphorylation signal also disappeared in the presence of Ran. From these experiments we can conclude that, in those complexes where VRK1 is interacting with Ran, VRK1 has a reduced kinase activity manifested both in its autophosphorylation and on its H3 specific target."
714,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Because VRK proteins, particularly VRK2 and VRK1, have a highly conserved amino-terminal region with their catalytic domain (397 amino acids), whether the kinase activity of both VRK2 isoforms was also inhibited by Ran was also determined (Fig. 7E). The kinase activity of both VRK2A and VRK2B in autophosphorylation and on H3 phosphorylation assays was inhibited by the Ran protein (Fig. 7E)."
715,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"VRK3 is a kinase-inactive protein, and it has been postulated that it can recover kinase activity by its interaction with an unknown protein. Therefore whether Ran could recover this activity was tested. An in vitro kinase assay was performed with VRK3 in the presence of the three forms of Ran; none of them recovered the kinase activity (Fig. 7E)."
716,PMC2577208,RESULTS,title_2,Interaction of VRK1 with Ran Does Not Affect the Nucleotide Exchange Activity of RCC1—
717,PMC2577208,RESULTS,paragraph,"Because VRK1 is a nuclear protein the effect on the activity promoted by the nucleotide exchange factor RCC1 was studied. One possible consequence of the interaction between VRK1 and Ran is to modulate the nucleotide exchange activity. To try to determine a possible effect, whether VRK1 could affect the release of GDP mediated by RCC1 was first determined. For this aim Ran was loaded with GDP, and the release of GDP was determined in the presence of different amounts of RCC1 with and without an excess of VRK1 protein. RCC1 induced a dose-dependent release of GDP that was not affected by VRK1 (Fig. 8A). Alternatively VRK1 might affect the loading of GTP on Ran induced by RCC1. This potential loading of GTP was studied at different time points using different concentrations of RCC1 with and without VRK1. RCC1 increased the amount of GTP bound to Ran in both a time- and an RCC1 dose-dependent way, but neither of them was affected by incubation in the presence of VRK1 (Fig. 8B). From these data it can be concluded that VRK1 does not affect the role of RCC1 in regulating the nucleotide exchange of Ran."
718,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,title_1,DISCUSSION
719,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The role of proteins interacting with VRK proteins can be of three main types: either substrates of the kinase reaction whose interaction is likely to be transient or regulatory proteins that either introduce covalent modifications or alternatively are able to form stable complexes by a protein-protein interaction, which might affect the enzymatic activity or specificity of VRK1. In this work we identified Ran as a negative regulator of VRK1 activity."
720,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The activation of kinases by small GTPases is a well known mechanism of which activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by Ras is probably the best known process. In the inverse situation, the regulation of kinase activity by interaction with a small GTPase is a little characterized effect; the only case identified is the activation of PAK1 activity by Cdc42. Ran has been shown to be an activator of Aurora A; thus small GTPase-kinase interactions can function as a switch of signaling pathways that play a role in different biological processes that need to be coordinated. However, there are no data regarding inhibition of kinase activities by their interaction with any small GTPase protein."
721,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The identification of a stable interaction between VRK proteins and the Ran GTPase opens up new possibilities from a regulatory point of view. The VRK1 protein is very stable and, in continuously growing cells, is always present at relatively high levels; because of that it has been associated with cell proliferation. But this kinase, which can regulate several transcription factors, may not always be necessary, and therefore it is likely to be regulated either spatially or temporally. The inhibition of VRK1 kinase activity by RanGDP suggests that its kinase activity might be regulated in time and space, a role already known for Ran in other functions such as in the localization to the nuclear pore during interphase of Mad1p and Mad2p, two spindle assembly checkpoint proteins. In general only one conformation of Ran has the effect on the target protein, and it is possible that the inhibition of VRK1 activity by RanGDP might be necessary for its nuclear import."
722,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The identification of a protein, Ran, that is able to modulate the kinase activity of a nuclear protein, VRK1, has functional consequences. This interaction implies that within the nuclei regions, where these two proteins interact, the kinase activity is inhibited when Ran is bound to GDP. Although in those areas where there is an interaction with the GTP-bound form the kinase is active. Thus although there is a homogeneous distribution of VRK1 protein in the nucleus, it does not imply a similar distribution of its kinase activity. This functional heterogeneity is an important concept regarding the function of both proteins. The VRK1 protein is also present in the cytosol of some cell types where Ran is in its inactive conformation; thus in cytosol, the activity of VRK1 is likely to be inhibited. The different compositions of protein complexes that implicate regulation of VRK1 activity are summarized in a diagram (Fig. 9), and their relative proportions in different subcellular location will determine the local effect of VRK1. In the cytosol, the interaction between Ran and VRK2 is more likely to play a relevant role, but the processes implicated still need to be identified and characterized. VRK2 modulates stress response to hypoxia or to IL-1β signal."
723,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Phosphorylation of histones by VRK1 was initially identified for histone H2B. Later the unique Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of this human kinase family, the NHK-1 (nucleosomal histone kinase), has also been shown to phosphorylate histones and is essential for chromosome condensation and mitotic progression. Histone H3 plays an important role in chromatin condensation once the DNA synthesis has been completed. Histone H3 can be phosphorylated by VRK1 in Thr-3 and Ser-10. H3 phosphorylation in Thr-3 has been shown to be required early in mitosis and was concentrated in the central region of the metaphase plate; but the kinase was not known although some studies have detected this activity. H3 phosphorylation in Ser-10 has been detected in mitogen-stimulated fibroblasts and is indispensable for cell transformation, which is also required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation. The subcellular location of H3 phosphorylated in Ser-10 has been detected concentrated in the periphery of chromosome packages in anaphase and telophase and reforming nuclei, thus presenting a different temporal and spatial pattern with respect to Thr-3 phosphorylation. VRK1 phosphorylation of H3 in both Thr-3 and Ser-10 contributes to nuclear condensation and might also be acting as a downstream target of other signaling kinases that have been shown to phosphorylate H3 in in vivo systems, such as MSK, or haspin. H3 phosphorylation in Ser-10 by MSK1/2 has been implicated in the activation of immediate-early response genes, a role that has also been identified for VRK13; and in this context, VRK1 might be an alternative kinase to the Pim1 kinase role in transcriptional complexes containing Myc."
724,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The effect of Ran on the activity of VRK1 indicates that within the nucleus and depending on the concentration of each protein they might have different roles creating a functional heterogeneity. VRK1 is located dispersed throughout nuclei, but Ran activation is dependent on the differential gradient of RCC1. This differential activity can have an important role in the regulation of its transcription factors by phosphorylation that includes p53, ATF2, c-Jun, and probably others that will be identified in the future. An alternative role of this inhibition of the phosphorylation by Ran might allow checking for the correctness of DNA replication. The formation of a complex with VRK1-Ran and non-phosphorylated RCC1 suggests that this complex is likely to be in a conformation that binds to chromatin rather than being implicated in nuclear transport that requires phosphorylation of RCC1. The importance of intracellular phosphorylation gradients is exemplified by the role of Aurora B in anaphase where there is a cross-talk between Aurora B activation and microtubules."
725,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although VRK1 does not appear to affect the nucleotide-bound state of Ran, it will be necessary to determine whether it modulates some of the effects associated with Ran, such as nuclear transport. Therefore the interaction between VRK proteins and Ran might have additional effects. The interaction region is conserved among the three VRK proteins and is shared with other small GTPase-binding proteins, making feasible the formation of different combinations depending on intracellular location."
726,PMC2577208,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, in this report we have shown that Ran GTPase, depending on its activation state, is able to regulate the kinase activity of the VRK1 and thus has the potential to generate areas within the cell with different kinase activity. This represents the first regulatory protein of VRK1 and one of the first nuclear kinases regulated by protein-protein interactions."

749,PMC2913976,TITLE,front,Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Functional Characterization of the Interactions of the PAR2 Ectodomain with Factor VIIa
750,PMC2913976,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Signaling of the tissue factor-FVIIa complex regulates angiogenesis, tumor growth and inflammation. TF-FVIIa triggers cell signaling events by cleavage of protease activated receptor (PAR2) at the Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond. The recognition of PAR2 by the FVIIa protease domain is poorly understood. We perform molecular modeling and dynamics simulations to derive the PAR2-FVIIa interactions. Docking of the PAR2 Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond to the S1 site and subsequent molecular dynamics leads to interactions of the PAR2 ectodomain with P and P’ sites of the FVIIa catalytic cleft as well as to electrostatic interactions between a stably folded region of PAR2 and a cluster of basic residues remote from the catalytic cleft of FVIIa. To address the functional significance of this interaction for PAR2 cleavage, we employed two antibodies with epitopes previously mapped to this cluster of basic residues. Although these antibodies do not block the catalytic cleft, both antibodies completely abrogated PAR2 activation by TF-FVIIa. Our simulations indicate a conformation of the PAR2 ectodomain that limits the cleavage site to no more than 33 A from its membrane proximal residue. Since the active site of FVIIa in the TF-FVIIa complex is ~ 75A above the membrane, cleavage of the folded conformation of PAR2 would require tilting of the TF-FVIIa complex toward the membrane, indicating that additional cellular factors may be required to properly align the scissile bond of PAR2 with TF-FVIIa."
751,PMC2913976,INTRO,title_1,INTRODUCTION
752,PMC2913976,INTRO,paragraph,"Tissue factor (TF) is a membrane-bound cell-surface protein and the primary initiator in the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade (reviewed in References). This pathway starts with TF’s exposure to the blood stream upon vessel damage, binding to its natural ligand the blood-borne factor VII (FVII), and activation of FVII to FVIIa. The TF-FVIIa binary complex activates the factor X (FX) to FXa, which eventually leads to blood clotting and drives downstream signaling by thrombin. Thus, the complex has been well known for its role in the initiation of coagulation. Besides this hemostatic role, the TF-FVIIa complex has also been found in recent years to regulate a broad range of non-hemostatic cellular responses including gene transcription, protein translation, apoptosis, and cytoskeletal reorganization (reviewed in References). These cellular responses in turn affect several cellular processes including inflammation, angiogenesis, and the pathophysiology of cancer and atherosclerosis (reviewed in reference). The TF-FVIIa complex elicits calcium transients in various cell types, and activates the three major MAP kinase family members p42/p44, p38, and JNK."
753,PMC2913976,INTRO,paragraph,"The primary signaling pathway of the TF-FVIIa complex involves activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs). PARs are G-protein-coupled receptors that have seven trans-membrane helices and are activated through proteolytic cleavage of their extracellular N-terminal domains by proteases (reviewed in Reference). The cleaved PAR N-terminus functions as a tethered ligand that folds back into PAR’s binding pocket and activates PAR, which leads to initiation of intracellular signaling cascades (reviewed in Reference). Among the four PARs discovered so far (PAR-1, PAR2, PAR-3, PAR-4), only PAR2 is directly cleaved by the TF-bound FVIIa, but both PAR-1 and PAR2 can be cleaved by FXa (reviewed in Reference). The TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 regulates gene transcription and protein translation, cell proliferation and survival, or cell motility and integrin activation (reviewed in Reference). In tumor cells, this signaling pathway regulates pro-angiogenic growth factor expression as well as integrins involving crosstalk with the TF cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Reference)."
754,PMC2913976,INTRO,paragraph,"The importance of TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 drives us to investigate how the serine protease domain of FVIIa cleaves the extracellular N-terminal ectodomain of PAR2. Although it is known that a serine protease cleaves PAR2 at the site between Arg36 and Ser37 to yield the tethered ligand SLIGRL, there is no structure or model to demonstrate what PAR2-FVIIa interactions other than those at the catalytic site are required to facilitate the cleavage. Knowing these interactions is essential not only to understand the cleavage mechanism but could also be useful in the development of inhibitors that selectively block this cleavage and the related signaling pathways. For example, to suppress tumor growth, it may be possible to develop a FVIIa inhibitor that selectively prevents PAR2 cleavage while still allowing coagulation initiation."
755,PMC2913976,INTRO,paragraph,"In this study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations and antibody epitope analysis to derive the PAR2-FVIIa interactions. First we built an extended PAR2 extracellular n-terminal polypeptide model with its Arg36 and Ser37 engineered into the catalytic site of FVIIa protease domain. We then simulated the complex of PAR2 and FVIIa protease domain for 4 ns in implicit solvent (to drive initial condensation of the PAR2 ectodomain and its approach to FVIIa) followed by 54 ns in explicit solvent (for simulating binding and sampling equilibrium configurations). The last 18-ns equilibrium simulation of the explicit solvent molecular dynamics has been used for analyzing PAR2-FVIIa interactions. Finally we report the resulting model interactions and an antibody study reporting on interactions distal to the active site."

757,PMC2913976,METHODS,title_2,1. Starting Structure
758,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The starting structure was built based on the crystal structure (PDB ID: 1DAN) of the TF-FVIIa complex inhibited by a partial-peptide compound Dpn-Phe-Arg-Ch2 (D-Phe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyllketone with chloromethylketone replaced by a methylene group). As the six human PAR2 amino acids at the cleavage site are Lys34-Gly35-Arg36-|-Ser37-Leu38-Ile39 (whole sequence in References), we altered the compound’s Dpn residue to Lys34, mutated Phe to Gly35, kept Arg as Arg36, and changed Ch2 to Ser37. We adjusted the configuration of Ser37 to satisfy the required interactions with the catalytic site of a serine protease (see Figure 11–27 of); the FVIIa catalytic site was monitored through the simulations see – Figure 1). Then we appended the ends of this four-amino acid peptide with the n-terminal Met1 and c-terminal Gly71 peptides respectively (Figure 2(A)). Gly71 is the last residue of PAR2 extracellular ectodomain prior to the first transmembrane helix in our human PAR2 homology model (Zhang Q, Ruf W, & Olson AJ, unpublished). (In the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, human PAR2 residues 1–75 are marked as extracellular (http://ca.expasy.org/uniprot/P55085); thus residues 72–75 are still extracellular although they are part of the first transmembrane helix.) The PAR2 n-terminal polypeptide was elongated on both sides of the Arg36-Ser37 scissile bond, leaving this area rigid and adjusting certain torsions of adjacent PAR2 polypeptide residues to reduce steric clashes where the chain enters and exits the FVIIa protease active site."
759,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"FVIIa has four domains: Gla, EGF1, EGF2, and protease. As PAR2 is cleaved by the protease domain and there is no evidence that the PAR2 ectodomain interacts with other FVIIa domains, we removed FVIIa’s Gla, EGF1, and EGF2 domains as well as TF from the TF-FVIIa complex in order to simulate the PAR2-FVIIa complex more efficiently. In the simulations, the FVIIa protease domain residues that interact with TF and FVIIa’s other domains are kept rigid to mimic the bound state. Water molecules that are more than 3 A from the FVIIa protease domain were removed as well as the cacodylate ion that is part of the crystallization buffer. The only ions remaining in the structure are one Ca2+ ion and one Cl− ion. The Ca2+ ion is essential for activation of FVII by TF and is located on the loop from Gly69 to Glu809. The Cl− ion is not documented to be of significance and may come from the CaCl2 solution. We kept this ion at the beginning of the simulation but eventually removed it during explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. PAR2 residue Asn30 is modified by an N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine (NAG) because glycosylation on this residues regulates human PAR2 expression and/or signaling. The NAG moiety was taken from the crystal structure of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) complexed with Gla domain of protein C (PC Gla) (PDB ID: 1LQV) in which there are 6 NAG-modified asparagines. The modeling was done in InsightII (Accelrys), and the resulting starting structure is shown in Figure 2(A)."
760,PMC2913976,METHODS,title_2,2. Force Field Assignments
761,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"Simulations were performed in AMBER 9 with the ff99 force field. This force field contains standard amino acids but no NAG-modified asparagines (NAG-Asn). Here we describe the procedure to build the topology and partial charges for NAG-Asn. The topology can be derived from any existing NAG-Asn residue, such as those in the EPCR-PC Gla complex (PDB ID: 1LQV). The partial charges, however, should be derived from all possible conformations of this residue since the conformation of this NAG-Asn30 residue is unknown. The NAG-Asn conformations were generated as combinations of three parts: (1) Asn conformations, (2) Asn-NAG torsions, and (3) NAG torsions. For the first part, AMBER gives two conformations C5 and αR with different torsions. For the second part, we sampled the torsions from the six NAG-Asn residues in the EPCR-PC Gla complex found two conformation classes named as L1 and L2 here. For the third part, the torsions were sampled from the same six NAG-Asn residues and were found to have two conformation classes as well, named as N1 and N2 here. Thus, we sampled a total of eight NAG-Asn conformations. While ideally the Asn-NAG torsions and NAG torsions should be sampled more extensively, the NAG-Asn30 residue was not a critical element of this study."
762,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"These eight conformations combined were used to compute the NAG-Asn atomic partial charges following the multi-conformational RESP procedure for amino acids. The procedure was partially automated by the R.E.D. II program, but the geometric optimization option or the molecular re-orientation option in the program was not applied. R.E.D. II in this case was used to sequentially execute (i) the Gaussian 03 program to compute the molecular electrostatic potential for each NAG-Asn conformation and then (ii) AMBER’s RESP program to fit the atom-centered partial charges to the grid determined in the previous step. In the second step, molecular equivalences between the eight conformations were applied in addition to the required atomic equivalences among each conformation, thus all the conformations have the same partial charges. The derived NAG-Asn topology and partial charges in the AMBER PREPI file format are provided in the Supporting Information S1."
763,PMC2913976,METHODS,title_2,3. Simulations in Implicit Solvent
764,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The starting structure has the PAR2 n-terminal polypeptide in an extended conformation from residue Met1 to the cleavage site and from the cleavage site to residue Gly71 (Figure 2(A)). Simulations of this starting structure in explicit solvent would have been extremely expensive since solvent has to fill a large box that encloses the entire extended complex. Thus, implicit solvent was used at the beginning to allow PAR2 to quickly condense and approach the FVIIa protease domain; then explicit solvent was used to simulate the binding and equilibrium configurations. All simulations were performed using AMBER 9 with the ff99 force field. The Ca2+ ion, which did not interact with PAR2 at any point of the implicit-solvent simulations, was distance-restrained to the oxygen atoms in the Ca2+ coordinated system."
765,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The implicit solvent simulation used a Generalized Born model (igb=5) with a distance cutoff of 16 A. It began with a four-step energy minimization: (1) 500 steps of steepest descent (SD) and 500 steps of conjugate gradient (CG) with a positional restraint of 100 kcal/mol/A2 on all heavy atoms including waters in order to equilibrate the hydrogen atoms; (2) 200 SD and 300 CG with a positional restraint of 100 kcal/mol/A2 on heavy atoms of PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 and FVIIa in order to partially remove steric collisions between PAR2 and FVIIa; (3) 200 SD and 300 CG with a positional restraint of 100 kcal/mol/A2 on heavy atoms of FVIIa only to further remove the steric collisions; (4) 50 SD and 300 CG with a positional restraint of 10 kcal/mol/A2 on heavy atoms of the rigid FVIIa residues. The rigid residues are those in FVIIa protease domain that are within 5 A of TF and other FVIIa domains. These residues do not interact with PAR2, and the restraint keeps the FVIIa protease domain in the form with which it binds to TF and the other FVIIa domains. In the energy minimizations, SHAKE (bond length constraints) was not used."
766,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"After energy minimization, the molecular dynamics simulation was initiated with a 10 ps equilibration phase to increase the system temperature from 0 to 310 K using Langevin dynamics (ntt=3) with a collision frequency of 5.0/ps. A restraint of 1 kcal/mol/A2 was applied to all residues to keep them stable during heating. The equilibration was followed by 4 ns of production dynamics with a constant 310-K temperature weakly coupled at every 2 ps (ntt=1). A restraint of 1 kcal/mol/A2 was applied to the heavy atoms of PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 residues, all FVIIa residues, ions, and waters in order to focus the computation on the PAR2 n-terminal peptide folding and approach to FVIIa. Other settings in molecular dynamics included the use of SHAKE (ntc=2; on bonds involving hydrogen), a time step of 2 fs, a salt concentration of 0.15 M, a solvent dielectric constant of 78.5, and the option to carry out GB/SA (generalized Born/surface area) simulation with surface area computed using the LCPO model (gbsa=1). The resulting structure is shown in Figure 2(B)."
767,PMC2913976,METHODS,title_2,4. Simulations in Explicit Solvent
768,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The explicit solvent simulation was initiated from the last snapshot of the implicit-solvent simulation (Figure 2(B)). This structure was first axis-aligned and then solvated in a TIP3 water box with buffer sizes of 10, 8, and 15 A in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively (a larger buffer size in Z direction was specified to prevent the solute from approaching the box edges in that direction). The system was neutralized with 44 Na+ and 50 Cl− counter ions, resulting in a physiological ionic strength of 0.15 M given the solvent volume in the water box. The system was then energy minimized without SHAKE in three steps: (1) 500 SD and 5500 CG with a restraint of 100 kcal/mol/A2 on the solute heavy atoms to relax hydrogen atoms; (2) 200 SD and 800 CG with a restraint of 10 kcal/mol/A2 on the solute heavy atoms to further relax hydrogen atoms and allow slight movement of the heavy atoms; (3) 200 SD and 800 CG with no restraint to relax all atoms."
769,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The energy minimization was followed by a four-step equilibration with SHAKE and a time step of 2 fs: (1) Heat up – 100,000 steps to increase temperature from 1 to 300 K, coupled at every 0.5 ps, at constant volume with a 10 kcal/mol/A2 restraint on the solute; (2) Constant pressure – 100,000 steps at 300 K, coupled at every 1 ps, with a 5 kcal/mol/A2 restraint on the solute; (3) More constant pressure– 100,000 steps at 300 K, coupled at every 2 ps, with a 3 kcal/mol/A2 restraint on the solute; (4) Final equilibration– 200,000 steps at constant pressure and 300 K, coupled at every 4 ps, with a 3 kcal/mol/A2 restraint on the rigid FVIIa residues."
770,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"The equilibration was followed by 53-ns of production dynamics (1 to 54 ns) at constant pressure with the use of SHAKE and a time step of 2 fs. In this long simulation, we carefully monitored the stability of the FVIIa catalytic site, the stability of the Ca2+ coordination system, the stability of the crystal Cl− ion, the interactions between PAR2 and FVIIa, and whether the water box was still large enough for the PAR2 ectodomain undergoing conformational changes. This simulation was initiated from the last snapshot of the equilibration phase (at 1 ns) with a restraint of 3 kcal/mol/A2 on the rigid FVIIa residues, FVIIa catalytic site residues, and PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37. The simulation subsequently underwent four parameters-changing events: (1) at 11 ns, the restraint on FVIIa catalytic site and PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 was removed in order to allow all interacting residues to move freely (the restraint on the rigid FVIIa residues was retained throughout); (2) at 15 ns, the atomic charges of the Gly71 carboxyl group were zeroed out to mimic Gly71 linked to the next amino acid; (3) at 19 ns, the atomic charge of the non-essential crystal Cl− ion was changed to zero to allow it to leave the PAR2-FVIIa interface (which it did); (4) at 33 ns, the system temperature was increased from room temperature of 300 K to a physiological temperature of 310 K. The PAR2-FVIIa complex structure averaged over the last 18 ns (36 to 54) is shown in Figure 2(C)."
771,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"In the explicit solvent simulations, the generalized Born model was not used (igb=0). The particle mesh Ewald method was used to calculate the long-range electrostatic interactions. The non-bonded distance cutoff was reduced to 8 A, and the Ca2+ ion was not distance-restrained to its binding oxygen atoms in case the ion interacted with PAR2. The Ca2+ ion is stable throughout the simulations and was not found to interact with PAR2. The van der Waals parameter for Ca2+ (R=1.3263 A, ε=0.4497 kcal/mol) was derived from Aqvist’s work instead of using the one in AMBER’s default ff99 force field parm99.dat (R=1.7131 A, ε=0.459789 kcal/mol for “C0”). The Aqvist’s parameter has the radius R close to those used in the force fields of CHARMM (1.3670 A) and OPLSAA (1.3537 A)."

Hydrogen bonds were computed by the CARNAL program in AMBER 8 (documented in AMBER 7 or earlier versions). Plots of RMSD and residue distances are drawn in Python using the matplotlib module (matplotlib.sourceforge.net). Molecular structures are visualized in either InsightII (Accelrys) or PMV (mgltools.scripps.edu)."
774,PMC2913976,METHODS,title_2,6. Antibody Study
775,PMC2913976,METHODS,paragraph,"TF-FVIIa signaling was studied in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that were transduced with adenovirus to express high levels of TF and PAR2. Cells were serum starved for 5 h, before stimulation with 10 nM FVIIa in the presence of 50μg/ml anti-FVII antibody 12D10 or 12C7. TF-FVIIa signaling was quantified by TagMan analysis measuring TR3 nuclear orphan receptor gene induction after 90 minutes of stimulation. For TagMan (Applied biosystems) 2μg total cellular RNA was reversed transcribed using oligo-dT primers (Superscript II reverse transcriptase, Invitrogen). All samples were normalized with human glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The epitopes of these antibodies have previously been mapped in detail with Ala exchange mutants in the FVIIa protease domain. In control experiments, the inhibitory effect of these antibodies on factor Xa (FXa) generation was confirmed using a parallel reaction, where the cells were incubated in the presence of 100 nM FX.

778,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"The FVIIa catalytic site was carefully monitored throughout the simulations to ensure that the key interactions between the FVIIa catalytic site and PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 were maintained. In vivo, these interactions are directly involved in PAR2’s cleavage by FVIIa. In our simulations these known interactions were used to tether the remaining PAR2 polypeptide, helping to accelerate interactions with the FVIIa protease domain. Even though in vivo some parts of the PAR2 ectodomain may bind FVIIa before docking of the Arg36 P1 residue, the simulation (started with Arg36-Ser37 in place) serve as an efficient way of discovering the binding modes between the PAR2 ectodomain and the FVIIa protease domain. Simulations to derive the final binding mode without any PAR2 residues in place would be highly challenging with current simulation techniques and computational speeds."
779,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"Figure 1 shows the FVIIa catalytic site after implicit-solvent energy minimization (Left) and explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (Right). FVIIa’s Asp102, His57, and Ser195 form the catalytic triad, while the amines of Ser195 and Gly193 form the oxyanion hole hosting PAR2’s Arg36:O (based on Figure 11–27 of). FVIIa’s His57 should have a hydrogen on the delta nitrogen (ND1) but not on the epsilon nitrogen (NE2), thus it is named as Hid57 (AMBER nomenclature). At the beginning (Left), His57:ND1 donates two hydrogen bonds to Asp102:OD1 & OD2 and His57:NE2 accepts a hydrogen bond from PAR2’s Ser37:N. The side-chain oxygen of Ser37 (OG) forms a hydrogen bond with both of the nitrogens of FVIIa’s His57. These two hydrogen bonds are apparently not required for cleavage by a serine protease and thus may have been artificially created in building the starting structure. They are eventually lost during molecular dynamics. The right-hand panel of Figure 1 shows the catalytic site averaged over the last 18 ns of the 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulation. In the last 43 ns, there were no positional restraints on the FVIIa catalytic site or PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37. Thus, PAR2’s Ser37 rotates away from FVIIa’s His57 and towards FVIIa’s Gly193. FVIIa’s His57:NE2, previous forming a hydrogen bond with PAR2’s Ser37:N, loses this hydrogen bond, forms a new hydrogen bonds with PAR2’s Arg36:N and with FVIIa’s Ser195:OG. This is a step back from cleavage as seen in the transition state diagram (Figure 11-27 of) where His57:NE2—Ser195:OG hydrogen bond occurs before, not after, the His57:NE2—Ser37:N hydrogen bond. It suggests that the simulations captured both hydrogen bonds at different times, but they did not appear in the right time sequence since bond formation and breaking at Arg36 and Ser37 were not part of the simulation. The four hydrogen bonds on the side-chain of Arg36 however were very stable despite movements of Asp189, Ser190, and Gly219 during the simulations. Overall, the transition state of the FVIIa catalytic site is maintained throughout the simulations thus facilitating meaningful interactions of other parts of the PAR2 extracellular polypeptide with the FVIIa protease domain."
780,PMC2913976,RESULTS,title_2,2. Structural Changes Along Simulation Trajectories
781,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"With PAR2’s Arg36-Ser37 in place, the other parts of the PAR2 ectodomain fold and approach the FVIIa protease domain as demonstrated in Figure 2, from starting structure (A) to the end of the 4-ns implicit solvent molecular dynamics (B) and to the last 18-ns average of 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (C). The implicit solvent molecular dynamics is stopped before other parts of the PAR2 bind to FVIIa. This allows water molecules to be added between PAR2 and FVIIa in order to simulate their binding in a fully solvated environment. The RMSDs of the FVIIa protease domain and PAR2 ectodomain as a function of simulation time in explicit solvent are shown in Figure 3. The four vertical lines mark the four parameter-changing events in the simulation (see METHODS). The FVIIa RMSD increases to 0.8 A during equilibration but only slightly increases after that. It is not affected by either Event 1 or 2, has a slight drop and then increase again after Event 3 (the crystal Cl− ion is released from the PAR2-FVIIa interface at 19 ns), and is mostly stable after Event 4 (increase of temperature to 310 K at 33 ns). The PAR2 RMSD fluctuations are expectedly much larger. It basically fluctuates between 5 and 9 A during 0–15 ns, fluctuations are smaller after Event #2 (the atomic charges of the Gly71 carboxyl group are changed to zeros), becomes stable after Event #3, and fluctuates between 8 and 12 A after Event #4. Thus, at physiological temperature the PAR2 ectodomain is more dynamic than it is at room temperature. Visualizing the trajectory we see that the most of the flexibility in the PAR2 ectodomain occurs before Arg31 and after Glu56, accounting for the fluctuation of the PAR2 RMSD (see also Supporting Information S2). We also note the stability of folded regions of the ectodomain that are distal from the cleavage site (see Figure 8). Considering the RMSD and parameter changes along the simulation, we have used the simulation trajectory between 36 ns (3 ns after the temperature is set to 310 K) and 54 ns (last snapshot) for the analysis of the PAR2-FVIIa interactions."
782,PMC2913976,RESULTS,title_2,3. Electrostatic Interactions
783,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"The charged PAR2 residues and their nearby charged FVIIa residues are shown in Figure 4 (Bottom). Besides Arg36 that interacts with FVIIa’s Asp189, there are three charged PAR2 residues– Arg31, Asp43, and Glu56– that may form electrostatic interactions with FVIIa. The possible electrostatic interactions of these three residues are plotted in Figure 4 (Top) as a function of simulation time. The final, stable PAR2-FVIIa electrostatic interactions are Arg31—Asp170g and Glu56—Arg62. The Arg31—Asp170g interaction is the most stable throughout the simulation and may have already formed during the implicit-solvent molecular dynamics. PAR2’s Glu56 and FVIIa’s Arg62 are initially 30 A apart but they approach and form an interaction within 13 ns. Long-range electrostatic influence of FVIIa’s Arg84 may help attract PAR2’s Glu56 during this process. PAR2’s Asp43 forms a transient electrostatic interaction with either FVIIa’s Lys60a or Lys60c within the first 11 ns but it is eventually lost due to the repulsion between Asp43’s neighbor Lys41 and these two FVIIa residues. The binding of PAR2’s Glu56 on FVIIa’s Arg62 at 13 ns apparently causes bending of the PAR2 polypeptide between Ser37 and Glu56, which also prevents PAR2’s Asp43 from binding to either FVIIa’s Lys60a or Lys60c."
784,PMC2913976,RESULTS,title_2,4. Hydrogen Bonds
785,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"The hydrogen bonds between the PAR2 ectodomain and FVIIa were computed over the last 18 ns of the explicit solvent molecular dynamics, and those with more than 25% occupancy (percent of time the hydrogen bond is intact) are reported in Table 1. Three sets of the PAR2-FVIIa hydrogen bonds are actually charge interactions, including Arg31—Asp170g, Arg36—Asp189, and Glu56—Arg62. The hydrogen bonds on PAR2’s Arg36 have been reported in Figure 2. The remaining six PAR2-FVIIa hydrogen bonds are novel, including three with occupancy larger than 50%: Leu38:N—Leu41:O (60%), Asp43:OD1/OD2—Asn37:ND2 (30.3%+29.4%), Val53:O—Asn60d:ND2 (97.9%). The residues involved in the six hydrogen bonds are mapped in Figure 5."
786,PMC2913976,RESULTS,title_2,5. Other Interactions
787,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"In addition to electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, there are significant van der Waals interactions between FVIIa and the PAR2 residues between Arg31 and Asp43 as shown in Figure 5. In the region where these PAR2 residues bind, FVIIa forms a relatively hydrophobic trapezoidal binding pocket surrounded by several polar residues. The PAR2 ectodomain enters the binding pocket along the one edge gated by FVIIa’s K170d and K192, makes a turn at Lys34, goes along on a second edge flanked by FVIIa’s K60a and K192, makes another turn at Leu38, and exits at the third edge ended at FVIIa’s N37. K192, although not participating in either electrostatic interaction or hydrogen bond, significantly shapes the binding pocket with the hydrophobic extent of its side-chain. Inside the binding pocket, there are two deep mini pockets, one hosting PAR2’s Arg36 and the other hosting Ile39. The former is anticipated and involves residues H57, D189, S190, C191, K192, G193, D194, S195, V213, S214, W215, G216, G219, C220, and G226. The latter is novel and includes residues Q40, W141, G142, Q143, T151, K192, and G193."
788,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"Interestingly, there are no stable PAR2-FVIIa interactions before PAR2’s Arg31 or after Glu56. These two ends contribute most to the RMSD fluctuations of PAR2 (Figure 3). Thus, Arg31 and Glu56 define the extent of the PAR2 substrate region that interacts with FVIIa. They also contribute to the charge complementarities between PAR2 and FVIIa. PAR2’s Arg31, Lys34, and Arg36 are close to the only two negatively charged FVIIa residues on the binding pocket surface: D170g and D60, while PAR2’s Asp43 and Glu56 are close to the positively charged FVIIa residues K60a, K60c, and R62. This charge complementarity, which involves long-range electrostatic interactions, presumably plays an important role in aligning the PAR2 n-terminal polypeptide correctly on the FVIIa protease domain during binding."
789,PMC2913976,RESULTS,title_2,6. Antibody Study
790,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"In order to address potential exosite interactions of PAR2 with the basic FVIIa residues Arg62, Arg84, Arg247, we evaluated the inhibitory effects on TF-FVIIa signaling of two monoclonal antibodies that were previously mapped to bind to this region of the FVIIa protease domain. The epitopes of 12C7 and 12D10 are overlapping, but located outside the catalytic cleft. The epitope of 12C7 contains FVIIa residues Arg247, Arg62, Arg84, and Gln87, while the epitope of 12D10 contains FVIIa residues Arg62, Arg84, and Asn63. Both antibodies have minimal effects on chromogenic substrate hydrolysis, but 12D10 produces more steric hindrance with macro molecular substrate factor X (FX) binding to FVIIa. Accordingly, 12D10 was a more potent inhibitor of Xa generation in comparison to 12C7 (Figure 6). Nevertheless, both antibodies completely inhibited TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 (Figure 6). These data provide evidence that the PAR2 binding to this FVIIa protease domain basic region makes significant contributions to the efficient orientation of the substrate to the enzyme."
791,PMC2913976,RESULTS,paragraph,"To understand the inhibition mechanism, we highlight the epitope residues in our FVIIa-PAR2 model in Figure 7. The FVIIa residue Arg62 in the epitopes of both 12C7 and 12D10 is seen to be interacting with PAR2, while the rest of the epitope residues do not (12D10 epitope residue Asn63’s side-chain is only ~4 A away from PAR2’s Val53 but does not form any significant interaction with PAR2). Arg62 has an electrostatic interaction with PAR2’s Glu56 (Figure 4) one of the key interactions that we see from the molecular dynamics simulations. The other major FVIIa-PAR2 interaction nearby is the hydrogen bond between FVIIa’s Asn60d and PAR2’s Val53 (Table 1 & Figure 5). Thus, 12C7 and 12D10 could inhibit TF-FVIIa signaling through PAR2 by blocking the electrostatic interaction between FVIIa’s Arg62 and PAR2’s Glu56 and probably the hydrogen bond between Asn60d and Val53 as well. However, charge reversal mutations (R62E/R84E) made to the FVIIa basic region do not inhibit PAR2 activation, as measured by the TR3 gene induction event (Figure 6). While this result does not eliminate the possibility that electrostatic interactions in this region help to guide substrate orientation under physiological conditions, it indicates that the specific interactions seen in the simulation are not essential for PAR2 cleavage to take place."
792,PMC2913976,DISCUSS,title_1,DISCUSSION
793,PMC2913976,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The derived PAR2-FVIIa interactions presented here may help in the design of small molecule inhibitors that block the PAR2 cleavage by FVIIa. Comparisons of these interactions with those present in FVIIa’s binding to other substrates can serve to guide the design of inhibitors that would selectively block a particular FVIIa substrate. The key PAR2-FVIIa interactions identified here include electrostatic interactions between stably folded regions of the PAR2 ectodomain and residues within the catalytic cleft. Most of the contacts are consistent with typical docking of substrates to serine protease domains. We find an insertion of PAR2’s P3’ Ile39 into a mini binding pocket formed by FVIIa residues Gln40, Trp141, Gly142, Gln143, Thr151, Lys192, and Gly193. This is somewhat unusual and transition state structures of serpin-serine protease domains typically show binding of P2’ Leu38 into this approximate area. The predicted interactions will require further mutagenesis studies to precisely confirm the energetic contributions of P and P’ interaction, as well as accessory contributions by the somewhat more remote charged residues."
794,PMC2913976,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The PAR2-FVIIa interaction and the relatively well defined structure of the carboxyl aspect of the PAR2 ectodomain raises an important question, i.e. how the FVIIa protease domain, which is well above cell membrane, approaches the PAR2 ectodomain that is directly anchored in the cell membrane. The distance between the active site of TF-bound FVIIa and the membrane is experimentally measured to be 75±2 A. However, from this simulation study the distance between PAR2’s Arg36 (in the FVIIa catalytic site) and Gly71 (four residues above membrane) is only 33±5 (Figure 8). The large discrepancy between these two distances suggests that the TF-FVIIa complex must be tilted toward the cell membrane, potentially by additional protein interactions in order for the FVIIa protease domain to bind and cleave the PAR2 extracellular tail. Although our antibody inhibition data are consistent with potential interactions of VIIa exosite regions during the initial docking of PAR2, another possibility is that the antibody inhibition of PAR2 activation results from steric interference with the required tilting of the TF-FVIIa complex."
795,PMC2913976,CONCL,title_1,CONCLUSIONS
796,PMC2913976,CONCL,paragraph,"In this work, we have simulated the binding of PAR2 extracellular ectodomain by the FVIIa protease domain through molecular modeling and a 4-ns implicit-solvent molecular dynamics followed by a 54-ns explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. These simulations maintain the transition-state interactions of the serine protease catalytic site with the substrate and reveal the molecular interactions that can facilitate PAR2-FVIIa binding. They also identify folded regions of the PAR 2 ectodomain that constrain the distance between the cell membrane and the activation cleavage site. The derived model thus implies that the TF-FVIIa complex must be tilted towards cell membrane in order to access and cleave the PAR2 extracellular tail."

822,PMC2922020,TITLE,front,Detecting and Understanding the Roles of Nitric Oxide in Biology
823,PMC2922020,ABSTRACT,abstract,"We are pursuing a dual strategy for investigating the chemistry of nitric oxide as a biological signaling agent. In one approach, metal-based fluorescent sensors for the detection of NO in living cells are evaluated, and a sensor based on a copper fluorescein complex has proved to be a valuable lead compound. Sensors of this class permit identification of NO from both inducible and constitutive forms of nitric oxide synthase and facilitate investigation of different NO functions in response to external stimuli. In the other approach, we employ synthetic model complexes of iron-sulfur clusters to probe their reactivity toward nitric oxide as biomimics of the active sites of iron-sulfur proteins. Our studies reveal that NO disassembles the Fe-S clusters to form dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs)."
824,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
825,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Nitric oxide (NO) has long been of interest to inorganic chemists because of the rich variety of coordination modes and spectroscopy displayed by transition metal nitrosyls. In addition to its appealing inorganic chemistry, a biological role for NO as the endothelium derived relaxation factor (EDRF) was identified nearly 30 years ago. NO serves as a secondary messenger by activating soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), inducing a downstream pathway that leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation. The mode of action of NO involves coordination to a heme-iron in the active site of sGC. Since these initial discoveries, the role of nitric oxide in biology has been studied extensively. A small free radical, NO elicits many physiological events. As for all signaling agents, NO homeostasis is crucial to its proper function, and misregulation of NO production is implicated in a large number of pathologies. In order to study the many roles of NO in biology, we are pursuing a dual strategy whereby we employ both cellular fluorescence imaging to monitor endogenously produced NO in a variety of biological contexts and we apply synthetic coordination chemistry to study the fundamental reactivity of NO with non-heme iron-sulfur complexes as biomimics of its cellular targets. Through this approach, we are able to probe chemical reactivity at crucial NO interaction sites under conditions of biological stimulation and, at the same time, introduce novel, bio-compatible visualization techniques to identify and establish possible new roles of NO in ex vivo systems."
826,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Probes for detecting nitric oxide in live cells
827,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Because nitric oxide is implicated in numerous biological processes significant to health and disease, investigating the roles of this signaling agent is critical to revealing biological function and continues to be an active area of research. Although many techniques are available to detect NO, including electrochemistry, magnetism, chemiluminescence, and absorbance, these methods often require electrodes or further chemical manipulations to accomplish detection. It is difficult to design such sensors to be suitable for direct, rapid, and resolved detection in living specimens. Fluorescence microscopy, however, is amenable to cellular and in vivo analyte sensing. The best biologically relevant fluorescent probes are cell membrane permeable, non-toxic, water-soluble, and excitable at low-energy wavelengths that do not harm cells or cause interfering autofluorescence. Additional desirable photophysical properties are a large dynamic range, selectivity, diffusibility, cell-trappability, reversibility, and rapid response times. In the best scenario, these probes can detect nitric oxide directly at its biological concentrations."
828,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"The field of NO probe design has improved dramatically over the past decades. Most new probes are designed with biocompatibility that renders them useful for cell, tissue, and possibly animal research. Despite this progress, some important goals remain to be achieved. Cell-trappability is an important probe feature that has been accomplished for organic NO-sensors but not metal-based NO-sensors. In order to understand the signaling properties of nitric oxide it would be valuable to identify the NO-production origin and subsequent cellular paths of the molecule. Sub-cellular localization of probes would assist in this regard. Quantitative reactive nitrogen species (RNS) detection using ratiometric probes would be valuable for measuring NO production upon cellular exposure to various stimuli. A major issue that needs to be addressed in future probe design is reversibility, which is required to get true spatiotemporal resolution. To be most useful, a reversible probe should report the time-dependent change in local NO concentration and not include other chemical reactions that restore the probe to its original off state."
829,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Small-Molecule Fluorescent NO-sensing Strategies
830,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Small-molecule fluorescent nitric oxide probes fall into two main categories, organic-based and metal-based. The organic probes are quenched fluorophores functionalized to create a species that is only emissive following reaction with NO or a derivative thereof. The most widely used organic probes contain an o-phenylenediamine moiety (Scheme 1a). Quenching is accomplished by a photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) mechanism in the excited state. The electron-rich vicinal amines alter the energy of the frontier orbitals in such a way as to facilitate PeT. In the presence of NO oxidized to N2O3, an electron-poor aryl triazole is formed, which sufficiently alters the energy of the frontier orbitals to abolish the PeT pathway and restore emission. These probes have been used extensively in biological experiments. A major limitation of these sensing agents, however, is the need to oxidize NO before it can react with the sensor, rendering them indirect detection systems unable to provide spatial or temporal information. Moreover, these probes are irreversible and offer no prospect for improvement in that regard."
831,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Metal-based probes take advantage of either direct NO reactivity at the metal center or reactivity at chelated ligand atoms. These probes provide an opportunity to explore direct and reversible sensing, because, unlike o-phenylenediamines, metals can interact reversibly with nitric oxide. Typically, metal-ligand constructs are assembled where the fluorophore is part of the ligand. Fluorophore emission is quenched by one of several PeT mechanisms. There are then three main strategies for eliciting a fluorescence response from these quenched systems in response to NO."
832,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_2,Fluorophore displacement
833,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"The simplest strategy to regain fluorophore emission is to remove it from the quenching site (Scheme 1b). This task can be accomplished either by releasing the ligand entirely or by removing a chelating arm to a sufficient distance from the metal. In both cases, ligand displacement accompanies nitric oxide binding to form a metal nitrosyl. Many metal-based NO-probes utilize this approach, including those containing Co(II), Fe(II), Ru(II) or Rh(II)."
834,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_2,Metal reduction
835,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Reduction of the metal to form a diamagnetic species can alleviate quenching caused by paramagnetic metal ions (Scheme 1c). Typically, this mechanism operates in protic solvents (ROH) and results in transfer of NO to the solvent to form an alkyl nitrite (RONO). This strategy has been employed primarily with Cu(II) probes, which are readily reduced by NO but fail to form stable Cu(I)-NO species. Copper(II) has also been incorporated into conjugated polymers to fashion NO-sensitive films using the intrinsic fluorescence of the polymer as the emitter. This tactic accommodates a wide range of modifications, such as incorporating water-soluble functional groups to facilitate biological compatibility."

837,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"A third mechanism for restoring fluorescence emission is both to displace the fluorophore and to reduce the paramagnetic metal center by reductive nitrosylation (Scheme 1d). In this process, NO can either coordinate to the metal or nitrosate either the ligand or solvent, when the latter is protic. The first example of this approach involved a paramagnetic cobalt(II) aminotroponiminate complex incorporating a dansyl fluorophore as part of the ligand. Upon reaction with NO in dichloromethane, one of the chelating arms was displaced and a diamagnetic cobalt-dinitrosyl complex formed. This reaction was accompanied by an ~8-fold emission enhancement over the course of 6 h. This strategy remains the most promising for biological NO detection and is further discussed below."
838,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Biologically Relevant Direct NO Detection
839,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"A fluorescent nitric oxide probe employing the third metal-based sensing strategy is CuFL1 (Scheme 2), a molecule that can detect NO in live cells. The advantages of this probe are its brightness, cell membrane permeability, minimal cytotoxicity, selectivity, and rapid fluorescent enhancement in the presence of NO. Upon exposure to excess nitric oxide, there is an immediate 11±2-fold increase in fluorescence that is complete within 5 min (16±1-fold total fluorescence enhancement). CuFL1 is selective for NO over a wide range of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), including nitrate, nitrite, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorite, peroxynitrite, superoxide, and nitroxyl. Importantly, endogenously produced NO can be visualized using CuFL1 in both iNOS- and cNOS-expressing cell lines in a time-dependent fashion when incubated with the appropriate NOS-inducing agent (Figure 1). Recently, a Cu(II) complex of 4-methoxy-2-(1H-naphtho[2,3-d]imidazol-2-yl)phenol (MNIP) operating by the same mechanism as CuFL1 was employed as a NO-specific probe in liver slices to study NO-induced inflammation during hepatic injury, demonstrating the applicability of this strategy in ex vivo tissue experiments."
840,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"The mechanism by which fluorescence enhancement occurs when CuFL1 is exposed to nitric oxide involves nitrosation of the secondary amine of the ligand and loss of copper. The ligand by itself is only weakly fluorescent. DFT calculations suggest that quenching of FL1 is due to PeT from one of the lone pair electrons on the aminoquinaldine into a half-filled fluorescein molecular orbital in the excited state. This electron-transfer event is possible because the lone pair of the aniline nitrogen atom on the quinoline (HOMO-1 orbital) occupies an sp orbital that is similar in energy to that of the HOMO orbital (Figure 2a). In the excited state, when electronic relaxation of the HOMO orbital occurs, the HOMO-1 orbital remains largely undisturbed because the nitrogen lone pair is delocalized onto the quinoline ring and increases in energy due to π-antibonding interactions (Figure 2b). As a result, the HOMO-1 orbital is higher in energy than the half-filled HOMO orbital in the excited state and therefore a competent donor orbital for PeT quenching. The emission of the ligand is further reduced when it forms a Cu(II) complex, due to the quenching by the paramagnetic center. Fluorescence studies confirmed that it is the CuFL1 complex, not the FL1 ligand, which senses NO. EPR experiments revealed that Cu(II) is reduced to Cu(I) during the reaction, but formation of a diamagnetic metal species alone is not responsible for the fluorescence enhancement because of PeT-induced self-quenching of the ligand. LC-MS and UV-vis studies of the product of the reaction revealed that Cu(I) is released and an N-nitrosated version of the ligand, FL1-NO, is formed. MS and UV-vis spectroscopic characterization of independently synthesized FL1-NO corroborated these results. 15N NMR spectral characterization of the product of the reaction of FL1 with 15NO2 under acidic conditions confirmed that the ligand could be nitrosated at the secondary amine to produce an emissive derivative, FL1-NO. The quantum yield of FL1-NO is 7.5-fold greater than that of FL1 and 9.2-fold greater than that of the copper complex, supporting the conclusion that FL1-NO is the species responsible for the fluorescence emission in these reactions. DFT calculations confirmed that FL1-NO has lost the ability to self-quench. When the aniline nitrogen atom is nitrosated, it adopts a trigonal planar geometry (Figure 2a), causing the molecular orbital containing the lone pair of the quinoline (HOMO-14 orbital) to be much lower in energy than in the un-nitrosated version (Figure 2b). The interaction of the lone pair on the aniline nitrogen atom with the π-system of the quinoline ring is attenuated by comparison to the situation in FL1. Instead, it delocalizes into the π-system of the formally NO+ fragment, producing a stabilized NO moiety of lower energy. It is assumed that this situation will also apply to the excited state, which would cause FL1-NO to emit."
841,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"There is more than one plausible intimate mechanism for this reaction. It is possible that, upon exposure of CuFL1 to NO, a transient copper-nitrosyl forms with attendant reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) and oxidation of NO to NO+. Upon deprotonation of the ligand aniline nitrogen atom, the NO+ would nitrosate the amine, resulting in ligand dissociation from the metal (Scheme 3a). It is possible that, instead of direct Cu(II)-NO bond formation, outer sphere electron transfer from NO occurs to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), forming NO+, which reacts with the ligand upon deprotonation. An alternative mechanism involves initial deprotonation of the aniline nitrogen atom, followed by attack of NO at that site to form the N-nitrosamine. Subsequent inner-sphere electron transfer to copper by the coordinated amido ligand would result in reduction to Cu(I) and ligand dissociation (Scheme 3b). Another possible result of ligand deprotonation is conversion of the resulting Cu(II)-NR2 to an aminyl radical Cu(I)–·NR2 species, which would readily react with NO. The mechanism by which a copper(II) dianthracenyl-cyclam complex (CuDAC) reacts with NO in a manner similar to CuFL1 has been investigated. CuDAC, like CuFL1, is non-emissive in the absence of NO, but in its presence fluoresces due to reduction of the paramagnetic Cu(II) center. Like CuFL1, the DAC ligand is N-nitrosated and dissociates from the metal center after reaction with NO. The reaction of CuDAC and NO is pH-dependent, and no copper-nitrosyl was observed during infrared studies of the complex. These results support a reaction mechanism like the second postulated scenario for CuFL1 (Scheme 3b)."
842,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Application of CuFL1: Determination of NO as a Virulence Factor in Bacillus anthracis
843,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Most nitric oxide produced in vivo is generated by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO via N-hydroxy-L-arginine. In eukaryotes, there are two major classes of the enzyme (euNOSes), constitutive and inducible, which produce different concentrations of NO after induction by different stimuli. Neuronal (nNOS) and endothelial (eNOS) nitric oxide synthases represent the constitutive forms of the enzyme (cNOS). They require activation to produce NO, a process that occurs after an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration activates calmodulin (CaM). Calcium binding to CaM induces a conformational change in this protein, which primes it for subsequent action on a variety of targets, including nNOS and eNOS, activating their catalytic functions. The NO-forming reaction occurs in the oxidase domain of cNOSes, which contains a heme responsible for L-arginine hydroxylation. A reductase domain supplies electrons required for turnover. The electrons are shuttled from flavin moieties in the reductase to the heme center after calmodulin binding alters the protein conformation to bring the oxidase and reductase domains into close proximity. Recently, a NOS from the Gram-negative bacterium Sorangium cellulosum has been isolated that is similar to eukaryotic NOSes. This enzyme uses a 2Fe2S ferrodoxin domain in the reductase instead of flavins to transfer electrons, and it utilizes either tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) or tetrahydrofolate (H4F) as cofactors, rather than only H4B in the euNOSes. Many Gram-positive bacteria also express a nitric oxide synthase, bNOS, which contains an oxidase that is homologous to that of the euNOSes. These enzymes differ from the eukaryotic ones because they lack a reductase domain in the protein. As a result, it was long thought that bNOS-expressing bacteria were incapable of producing NO in vivo. However, NO production has been demonstrated by three Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, and Staphylococcus aureus. It is hypothesized that these bNOS-expressing bacteria recruit non-committed reductases to provide electrons for catalysis."
844,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Anthrax infection is caused by Bacillus anthracis, one of the NO-generating bacteria. Cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and inhalation anthrax infections are all potentially fatal, but inhalation anthrax is the most deadly because of its ease of spread, rapid uptake into the body, and potent action. When these bacteria enter the body they are taken up by the host’s macrophage cells, which attempt to kill the bacteria by attacking them with an onslaught of reactive oxygen species including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. B. anthracis is potent in part because it can defend itself against such an attack by using nitric oxide as an important virulence factor. B. anthracis (Sterne) pre-treated with NO have increased viability against hydrogen peroxide exposure and a bNOS deficient strain of the bacterium has increased susceptibility to attack by cultured macrophages. Moreover, the bNOS knockout strain of B. anthracis exhibits reduced virulence in mice. It is hypothesized that the bacterium uses NO in a dual mechanism to assuage attack by the host. Firstly, NO activates bacterial catalase, which decomposes hydrogen peroxide to water and dioxygen. Secondly, NO helps to suppress Fenton chemistry, thereby reducing hydroxyl radical production and subsequent nucleic acid, protein and lipid damage. In order for Fenton chemistry to operate catalytically, the ferric iron generated in the reaction must be converted back to ferrous iron, a process that is accomplished by using cysteine as the reductant in bacteria. Nitric oxide inhibits the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase (Trx/TrxRed) system, the only system for thiol reduction in many bacteria. NO-mediated protection is crucial to bacterial survival because it does not rely on the initiation of protein synthesis, which is time- and energy-consuming. Instead, NO production affects the target proteins and protects the bacterial cells immediately, providing a valuable defense weapon for bacteria germinating inside macrophages."
845,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"The observation that NO is required for bacterial survival in a host suggests that a bNOS inhibitor would make a good antibacterial agent against Bacillus anthracis and related pathogens, provided that the compound was specific for bNOS over the eukaryotic enzymes. Bacterial NO synthase is a novel antibacterial target, because NO production occurs in a number of Gram-positive bacteria and, as such, might prove to be a general virulence factor. Because the bNOS enzyme lacks a reductase domain it is possible that inhibition of the reduction step would prove to be useful as a strategy for selective inhibition of bNOS. Using CuFL1, a protocol for measuring NO production in E. coli transfected with the B. anthracis bNOS was established. This protocol revealed that the NO production times in bacteria vs. macrophages are very different. The latter use inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which, unlike cNOSes, must be activated by immunogenic agents, such as cytokines. Inducible nitric oxide synthase is regulated at the transcription level and its basal expression levels are negligible. Activation involves upregulation of the iNOS mRNA, which after a few hours is translated into the functional enzyme. The different NO-production kinetics of cNOSes and iNOS offers a window of opportunity for using CuFL1 to discover selective inhibitors of the former (Figure 3)."
846,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Chemistry of nitric oxide with non-heme iron
847,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"In this and the following sections we turn our attention from the detection of NO to a discussion of its reactivity at non-heme iron sites. We focus on non-heme iron because the NO chemistry of this class of compounds is less developed than that of its heme-containing counterparts. Unlike the interaction of nitric oxide with heme iron, the chemistry of NO with non-heme iron targets in biology can result in dramatic modifications of the metallocofactor. As a consequence, detailed knowledge of physiologically relevant reactions at these sites is challenging to obtain because both the coordination number and nature of the ligands can change during reaction. Despite such challenges, studies of several proteins that contain non-heme iron centers have identified possible physiological roles for NO in transcriptional regulation and iron mobility. Non-heme iron has also been recognized as a target of NO toxicity. Among non-heme sites targeted by NO, iron-sulfur clusters have received special attention because of their propensity to react with nitric oxide and their involvement in both physiological and pathological processes mediated by NO. The inorganic chemistry of NO with iron-sulfur cluster compounds has a rich history, dating back to Roussin’s preparation of the eponymous black salts discovered while studying the action of sulfur on solutions of sodium nitroprusside. Chart 1 displays several common iron-sulfur nitrosyl compounds, many of which still bear Roussin’s name."
848,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"In most instances, reaction of an iron-sulfur cluster protein with nitric oxide leads to disassembly of the Fe-S core and formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs). DNICs can exist in a variety of forms (Chart 1) and oxidation states. Prototypical DNICs, which contain a single iron atom, are S = ½ paramagnets designated as {Fe(NO)2} species in the Enemark-Feltham notation. The doublet ground state gives rise to a very characteristic axial EPR signal at gav = 2.03. This common spectroscopic signature has aided the identification of DNICs in both synthetic and biological contexts, dating back several decades to early studies on human liver samples displaying extra-hepatic obstructive jaundice. DNICs typically take the form [Fe(NO)2(X)2]−, where X is assumed to be a thiol-derived ligand such as a protein-based cysteinate residue or a mobile species such as glutathione. The nature of the non-nitrosyl ligands in DNICs is uncertain, however, and ligand substitution reactions with N or O atom donors can be facile. The single example of a crystallographically characterized, protein-bound DNIC contains a tyrosinate ligand (Figure 4). EPR spectroscopy is not always capable of distinguishing between potential ligands for the {Fe(NO)2} fragment, and numerous examples of synthetic DNICs containing non-thiol ligands have been reported."
849,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"DNICs can exist in equilibrium with dimeric analogs known as Roussin’s red esters (RRE, Chart 1). Several factors including solvent polarity, concentration, and the nature of the thiolate ligand can influence which species predominates in solution. Unlike DNICs, RRE derivatives are EPR silent due to antiferromagnetic coupling between the two {Fe(NO)2} units, which gives rise to a diamagnetic ground state. Consequently, identification of these species biologically is more difficult. Both UV-vis and Mössbauer spectroscopy have been employed to aid in the identification of protein-bound RREs, although assignments are tenuous because many of the spectroscopic properties of the DNIC and RRE are similar."
850,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"DNICs display an electrochemically reversible one-electron reduction corresponding to the {Fe(NO)2}9/10 couple. Chemical reduction of thiolate-bound DNICs, however, results in formation of the reduced Roussin’s red ester derivative (rRRE Chart 1). Certain rRREs can also exist in equilibrium with the corresponding DNICs by autoxidaion of the coordinating thiolate ligands. As with the DNIC-RRE equilibrium, the nature of the solvent and the thiolate ligand is important in determining which species predominates. Not surprisingly, one-electron reduction of RRE derivatives also gives rise to the corresponding rRREs. Reduced Roussin’s red esters have been detected in nitrosylated protein samples that have been subjected to reduction. In older reports, this species was sometimes erroneously referred to as a “d9 DNIC”, the prototypical DNIC having been designated as a “d7 DNIC”. Recent work has unambiguously identified the reduced DNIC as a bimetallic species containing antiferromagnetically coupled {Fe(NO)2}−{Fe(NO)2} centers. This electronic configuration gives rise to an S= ½ ground state that displays an axial EPR signal centered at gav = 1.99. This signal has been detected when iron-sulfur clusters are exposed to NO, but only after subsequent treatment with a reducing agent. It therefore remains to be determined whether the presence of rRRE in protein samples arises from reduction of pre-existing RREs or from transformation of protein bound DNICs."
851,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Apart from their appearance as products of iron-sulfur cluster nitrosylation, DNICs have garnered a great deal of interest due to their potential role as NO storage and transfer units. The transfer of nitrosyl ligand(s) between metal centers is not only an intriguing reaction from the standpoint of inorganic chemistry but may also be an important way that biology stores the reactivity of NO for targeted delivery to a remote site of action. Several NO-mediated responses can be turned on with DNICs, and formation of dinitrosyl iron complexes has been suggested as a possible means of attenuating NO toxicity in cells. DNICs also play an important role in protein nitrosation, a reaction that cannot be performed by NO alone. Dinitrosyl iron complexes therefore represent an interesting bioinorganic cofactor, being both the end products of nitrosylation and mobile units that deliver nitric oxide in a controlled manner."
852,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Mononuclear Fe thiolates
853,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"As an entry point into the chemistry of NO with non-heme iron, we chose to examine reactions of iron(II) thiolates. We reasoned that the reactivity of these simple complexes with NO would provide a framework with which to understand the chemistry of more complex iron-sulfur clusters. Treatment of [Fe(SR)4]2− with NO gas or the conveniently prepared thionitrite, trityl-S-nitrosothiol, leads to formation of the corresponding DNICs, [Fe(NO)2(SR)2]−. During the course of the reaction, Fe(II) is reduced to {Fe(NO)2}, which formally contains Fe(I). The necessary reducing equivalent is provided by the thiolate ligand, which is converted to the disulfide. Formation of the DNIC occurs through the intermediacy of a mononitrosyl iron complex (MNIC), [Fe(NO)(SR)3]− (Scheme 4). This species, designated as {Fe(NO)} in the Enemark-Feltham notation, has an S = 3/2 ground-state in contrast to heme-type {Fe(NO)} species for which S = 1/2. EPR spectra of the MNIC are very similar to those obtained upon treatment of mammalian ferritin with gaseous NO, suggesting that under appropriate biological conditions these species may form in addition to DNICs. Four-coordinate mononitrosyl iron complexes such as [Fe(NO)(SR)3]− are rare but have been known for several decades. Typically, thiolate-bound MNICs are challenging to isolate because of their propensity to disproportionate into DNICs and Fe(III) thiolates. If two equivalents of NO+ are used in place of NO, [Fe(SR)4]2− transforms to the RRE derivative (Scheme 4). This reaction also occurs via the intermediacy of the MNIC, but results in oxidation of additional equivalents of thiolate. Chemistry of the Fe(III) thiolate, [Fe(SR)4]−, with NO has also been examined and proceeds to the DNIC through the MNIC as with the Fe(II) complex. The reactivity of these iron thiolates demonstrates that RS− ligands are capable of providing the necessary reducing equivalents to transform Fe(II) or Fe(III) to {Fe(NO)2} species."
854,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Fe2S2 clusters
855,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"The reaction of synthetic iron-sulfur clusters (both Fe2S2 and Fe4S4) with nitric oxide was first communicated in 1985. These studies demonstrated the propensity for cluster disassembly by NO gas and NO2−, but left unanswered the precise nature of the nitrosylation products. Subsequent work from our laboratory and elsewhere has definitively identified dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) as the products of synthetic iron-sulfur cluster nitrosylation (Scheme 5). This finding appears to be general for a variety of synthetic Fe2S2 and Fe4S4 clusters, and is in good agreement with the large amount of data obtained from studies of iron-sulfur proteins."
856,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,Oxidized versions of synthetic Fe2S2 clusters react in a straightforward manner with NO (g) or nitrosothiol to generate two equivalents of the respective DNIC and elemental sulfur (eq 1).
857,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Unlike the reaction of NO with homoleptic iron thiolates, [Fe(SR)4]2−/1−, which proceeds with oxidation of the coordinated thiolate, the NO chemistry of Fe2S2 clusters appears to involve modification of only the sulfide ligands. We have not been able to observe any intermediates in this reaction nor have we identified the allotrope of sulfur that is formed. Addition of fewer than four equivalents of NO to solutions of [Fe2S2(SPh)4]2− results in a mixture of [Fe(NO)2(SPh)2]− and unreacted Fe2S2 cluster, suggesting that cluster disassembly by NO is rapid and that intermediate nitrosylation products are too unstable to observe. The elemental sulfur that is formed by destruction of the Fe2S2 cluster can further react with the DNIC, resulting in oxidation of the thiolate ligands and formation of the nitrosylated Fe4S3 cluster known as Roussin’s black salt (Chart 1). The exact stoichiometry of this reaction is unknown, although a formal balanced equation can be written that accounts for formation of RBS and disulfide (eq 2)."
858,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"For Fe2S2 clusters containing aryl thiolates (PhS−, p-tolylS−), subsequent oxidation of the thiolate ligands by sulfur is slow and the DNIC can be isolated from the reaction mixture. With alkyl thiolates such as [(SCH2)2-o-C6H4]2− (S2-o-xyl2−) oxidation is facile and the thiolate ligands are lost as disulfides resulting in formation of [Fe4S3(NO)7]−. Trapping the elemental sulfur as the phosphine sulfide can obviate this additional reactivity and allow for isolation of alkyl thiolate-bound DNICs. The fate of the sulfide ligands in reactions of biological iron-sulfur clusters with NO remains unknown, although the results with synthetic systems suggest that sulfur byproducts must be sequestered from the vicinity of the iron atoms in order for the DNICs to remain stable. Interestingly, the reverse of cluster nitrosylation has been demonstrated in aerobically growing E. coli cells in the presence of L-cysteine and cysteine desulfurase (IscS). The fact that only sulfur is required for this chemistry is consistent with results using synthetic clusters. Dioxygen may play an important role in these reactions, trapping NO as NO2 or other nitrogen oxides and effectively removing NO. The synthetic cluster, [Fe2S2(S5)2]2−, can be regenerated from the DNIC, [Fe(NO)2(S5)]−, in the presence of S8 and Fe(1,2-benzenedithiolate)2, which serves as a trap for NO. Transformation of the synthetic DNIC, [Fe(NO)2(SEt)2]−, into the corresponding Fe2S2 cluster can also occur via the intermediacy of Roussin’s red salt (Chart 1). Because this chemistry requires additional thiolate equivalents in the form of [Fe(SR)4]−, it is unlikely to be a true model of Fe2S2 repair in vivo, albeit a most interesting reaction."
859,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Fe4S4 clusters
860,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Reaction pathways of synthetic Fe4S4 clusters with nitric oxide are more difficult to describe in detail because of the added complexity of the larger {Fe4S4}2+ core. Reaction of Fe4S4 clusters from aconitase, HiPIP, and endonuclease with nitric oxide all lead to formation of protein bound DNICs. As with Fe2S2 clusters, the repair of Fe4S4 clusters by DNICs has been demonstrated in both protein and synthetic systems. Our investigations of the reactivity of several synthetic Fe4S4 clusters with varying equivalents of NO gas or trityl-S-nitrosothiol revealed the thermodynamically stable Roussin’s black salt to be the major product of cluster nitrosylation (Scheme 5). Both the corresponding DNIC and the nitrosylated Fe4S4 clusters, [Fe4S4(NO)4]n− (n = 1, 2), were also detected in minor quantities by IR spectroscopy. Whether or not these mononitrosyl iron-sulfur clusters represent intermediates in the conversion of [Fe4S4(SR)4]2− to RBS or result from alternative reaction pathways is not known. In all cases, the corresponding disulfides were isolated as reaction products, indicating that the thiolate ligands were oxidized in the process. These results stand in contrast to work with Fe4S4 cluster proteins, where treatment with NO leads to the formation of protein-bound DNICs. However, when the reaction of NO with the prototypical synthetic cluster [Fe4S4(SPh)4]2− was carried out in the presence of added PhS−, [Fe(NO)2(SPh)2]− was detected as the major iron-containing reaction product. These results again suggest that at least two thiolate ligands are required to stabilize DNICs and prevent further reactivity in the presence of elemental sulfur. By comparison, when the sulfide-free Fe4 cluster, [Fe4(SPh)10]2−, was treated with NO, the DNIC and RRE were formed in a 2:1 ratio (eq 3), consistent with the thiolate ligands providing all of the necessary reducing equivalents."
861,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"It therefore appears that in both Fe2S2 and Fe4S4 clusters the sulfide ligands are oxidized during disassembly of the Fe-S core. Without a means of sequestering the sulfur byproducts, however, the resulting DNICs react further with elemental sulfur to form the thermodynamically stable Roussin’s black salt. RBS is toxic to living cells and without ligand substitution lacks an available site for attachment to proteins. It is therefore unlikely that RBS plays an important role in biological iron-sulfur cluster nitrosylation. As observed with HiPIP from C. vinsoum, iron can be lost during nitrosylation of protein-bound Fe4S4 clusters, resulting in a thiolate-to-iron ratio sufficient to stabilize DNICs against transformation to RBS."
862,PMC2922020,INTRO,title_1,Non-thiolate Fe2S2 clusters
863,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"While studying the reactions of synthetic Fe2S2 clusters, we discovered that the abiological cluster, [Fe2S2Cl4]2−, reacts with NO in a fashion identical to that of its [Fe2S2(SR)4]2− thiolate analogues (eq 4)."
864,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"This result suggested a commonality in the chemistry of compounds containing the {Fe2S2}2+ core with nitric oxide. In a biological context, very little work has been devoted to the reactivity of nitric oxide with iron-sulfur clusters containing non-thiolate ligands. Such reactions are of interest because a variety of important Fe2S2 clusters contain at least one non-cysteinate ligand. Furthermore, many potentially ligating amino acid residues other than cysteine lack the capacity for redox chemistry and therefore may display different chemistry in reactions with NO. Based on our results with the thiolate- and chloride-bound Fe2S2 clusters, we hypothesized that the chemistry of other Fe2S2 might be expected to follow the same pathway outlined in eq 4. Indeed, we discovered that a synthetic Rieske-type Fe2S2 cluster, [Fe2(μ-S)2(BIPM)(S2-o-xyl)]2−, could be nitrosylated to the corresponding N-bound and S-bound DNICs (Scheme 6)."
865,PMC2922020,INTRO,paragraph,"Although many examples of DNICs coordinated by nitrogen-donor ligands exist, [Fe(NO)2(BIPM)]− is the first such complex to be prepared by nitrosylation of an iron-sulfur cluster. As for prototypical DNICs, [Fe(NO)2(BIPM)]− demonstrates a reversible one-electron reduction in acetonitrile at −1.98 V (vs Fc/Fc+), assigned to the {Fe(NO)2}9/10 couple (Figure 5). Unlike DNICs containing thiolate ligands, DNICs containing nitrogen ligands might be expected to undergo redox reactions without decomposition because of a lesser propensity for ligand oxidation. With a related DNIC containing a 2,6-diisopropylphenyl-substituted β-diketiminate ligand we isolated a homologous set of {Fe(NO)2}9/10 redox partners (Figure 6). These species will facilitate investigations into how changes in the redox state of the DNIC influences both structure and reactivity, particularly in NO transfer processes. Such a redox switch would be a useful means by which nature could control the storage and release of NO equivalents from DNICs."

867,PMC2922020,CONCL,paragraph,"Detailed knowledge of the chemical reactivity of nitric oxide in the biological milieu is required for a complete understanding of its physiology and pathology. We have explored this reactivity by identifying where NO is produced and how it is utilized in cells using fluorescent probes and, in biomimetic chemistry, by investigating the fundamental inorganic chemistry of NO with iron-sulfur protein active site models. This dual approach is well suited to the study of small molecules of biological interest like nitric oxide, and we envision that it may also be successful in studies of other such species including peroxynitrite, nitroxyl, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide."

887,PMC3507680,TITLE,front,Zinc Transporter 8 (ZnT8) Expression Is Reduced by Ischemic Insults: A Potential Therapeutic Target to Prevent Ischemic Retinopathy
888,PMC3507680,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The zinc (Zn++) transporter ZnT8 plays a crucial role in zinc homeostasis. It’s been reported that an acute decrease in ZnT8 levels impairs β cell function and Zn++ homeostasis, which contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although ZnT8 expression has been detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), its expression profile in the retina has yet to be determined. Furthermore, the link between diabetes and ischemic retinopathy is well documented; nevertheless, the molecular mechanism(s) of such link has yet to be defined. Our aims were to; investigate the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina; address the influence of ischemia on such expression; and evaluate the influence of YC-1; (3-(50-hydroxymethyl-20-furyl)-1-benzyl indazole), a hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) inhibitor, on the status of ZnT8 expression. We used real-time RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot in the mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) and Müller cells to evaluate the effects of ischemia/hypoxia and YC-1 on ZnT8 expression. Our data indicate that ZnT8 was strongly expressed in the outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), and nerve fiber layer (NFL), whereas the photoreceptor layer (PRL), inner nuclear layer (INL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) showed moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that retinal ischemic insult induces a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the message and protein levels, YC-1 rescues the injured retina by restoring the ZnT8 to its basal homeostatic levels in the neovascular retinas. Our data indicate that ischemic retinopathy maybe mediated by aberrant Zn++ homeostasis caused by ZnT8 downregulation, whereas YC-1 plays a neuroprotective role against ischemic insult. Therefore, targeting ZnT8 provides a therapeutic strategy to combat neovascular eye diseases."
889,PMC3507680,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
890,PMC3507680,INTRO,paragraph,"Zinc (Zn++) is the second most abundant transition metal in mammals. Since Zn++ is utilized in a number of biological processes, its homeostasis is tightly controlled on both; the systemic and cellular levels via different mechanisms. Zinc homeostasis is regulated by an array of zinc transporters, controlling its movement from the extracellular space to the cytosol, and from the cytosol to intravesicular space. Two types of transporters exist; zinc transporter (ZnT) and Zrt- and Irt-like proteins (ZIP). There are 10 ZnTs (SLC30A) and 14 ZIPs (SLC39A), which have been identified in mammals with different tissue expression, cellular localization and regulation, and their expression is dependent on tissue and cellular status. The SLC30A efflux is localized in the membrane of the insulin secretory vesicles and it facilitates the accumulation of zinc from the cytoplasm into the insulin-containing vesicles. It plays a major role in providing zinc for insulin maturation and/or storage processes. Whereas the SCL39A influx transporter family, Zrt-Irt-like Protein (ZIP) acts in an opposing manner to increase intracellular Zn++ levels. A major role of Zn++ in the pathogenesis of DM is not surprising since Zn in β cell secretory vesicles is essential for insulin hexamerization. This is supported by the findings that polymorphism in a genetic variant of ZnT8 (SLC30A8) is associated with increased risk of type 2 DM (T2DM). Furthermore, ZnT8 (SLC30A8) has been reported as an auto-antigen and a major susceptibility gene for type 1DM (T1DM) and T2DM, respectively. These autoantibodies are present in 60–80% of new cases of T1DM. Dysregulation in Zn++ homeostasis is firmly implicated in the pathophysiology of many acute neural injuries and chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, perturbations in Zn++ homeostasis disrupt carbohydrate metabolism; however, the inverse relationship is also true: DM and hyperglycemia alter Zn++ balance, promoting hypozincemia and hyperzincuria. The importance of Zn++ in biological processes is crucial to housekeeping proteins, cellular metabolism, and gene expression. It provides structural stability to the Zn++ finger domains of many DNA-binding proteins and is a cofactor for more than 300 metalloenzymes, in which it is an essential element for the catalytic and/or structural integrity. Beta cells have insulin-containing vesicles, which also contain high intracellular concentrations of Zn++. Furthermore, Zn++ facilitates the packaging of insulin into hexamers through two Zn++ ions, a step necessary for insulin crystallization."
891,PMC3507680,INTRO,paragraph,"Chimienti and co-workers originally described the zinc transporter encoded by SLC30A8; ZnT8, as a pancreatic islet-expressed protein is associated with the ZnT family of intracellular Zn++ transports. Loss of ZnT8 from pancreatic β cells reduces insulin content and compromises insulin release. Interest in the role of zinc in the pathogenesis of DM was re-erupted with the discovery of the association between T2DM and a genetic polymorphism in the SLC30A8 gene. This polymorphism, which is caused by the minor allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs1226634 (C/T transition; Arg {325}–Trp 273 {325}), was subsequently shown to be associated with the presence of altered glucose homeostasis, pancreatic β cell dysfunction, or overt T2DM in many but not all study populations. Furthermore, the insulin producing pancreatic β cells contain some of the highest levels of Zn++ in the body. This high Zn++ content is largely due to the critical function of Zn++ for insulin synthesis, secretion and signaling, and the role that may play in the protection against oxidative stresses. Zinc deficiency may predispose individuals to DM and its cardiovascular complications. Overall, ZnT8 may contribute to the pathogenesis of DM due to autoantigenic properties as well as decreased protein function, which may be exacerbated by polymorphic variance."
892,PMC3507680,INTRO,paragraph,"Zn++ plays an essential role in the retinal function; this is echoed by its relatively high content in ocular tissue with the retinal being the highest. It has been revealed that the RPE and the choroid contain the highest levels of zinc concentrations in the retina. Several reports addressed the role of Zn++ in oxidative damage to the retina. In addition interactions between Zn++ and the antioxidant amino acid taurine have long been addressed. Recent studies have indicated that the intracellular localization of Zn++ pools in photoreceptors changes with light exposure, with the greatest intensity of Zn++ staining observed in the perikarya of photoreceptors of dark-adapted retinas and in the inner segments of light-adapted retinas. Furthermore, the expression of ZnT8 has been detected in the primary human fetal RPE cultures and human ARPE19 cell line; whereas pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) induced a strong increase of ZnT8 mRNA levels in these cells. In addition, it has been reported that ZnT8 is upregulated in the RPE cell layer located in the mouse retina of the Hfe−/− mouse. The Hfe−/− mouse is a knockout mouse model of hereditary hemochromatosis; a common autosomal recessive disease characterized by increased iron absorption and progressive iron storage that results in damage to major organs in the body. The Hfe−/− mouse exhibits profound differences in parameters of iron homeostasis."
893,PMC3507680,INTRO,paragraph,"Given the importance of tightly-regulated zinc homeostasis for normal retinal cell physiology, we examined whether the effects of ischemia/hypoxia on Müller cells, in vivo and in vitro, may be mediated, in part, through altered expression of zinc transporters. This study aims to address the impact of ischemic injury on the expression of ZNT-8 in glial cells and the ischemic retina. This investigation has also examined the effects of YC-1 treatment on the expression of ZnT8 transporter expression in the Müller cell line (rMC-1) and the injured ischemic retina."

Müller cells (rMC-1) were treated with either YC-1 (25–100 µM) or DMSO (0.2% v/v) for 48 hr under normoxic or hypoxic environments. Reactions were terminated by addition of lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Western Blot analysis was conducted, as previously described. Briefly, protein content of the cell lysates was determined according to the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Aliquots (40 µg) of whole-cell lysates were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and electro-transferred onto polyvinylidene membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T, the blots were incubated overnight with anti-(ZnT8, and β-actin {internal control}) antibodies. Negative control experiments consisted of omission of the ZnT8 antibody and utilizing a goat anti-rat IgG (isotype control antibody) as a replacement. Then blots were washed 3 × 10 min washes in PBS/tween and subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody at 1∶3000. The signals were obtained by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and visualized by exposure to X-ray film. Upon completion of chemiluminescence, equal lane loading was checked by Ponceau S Solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

910,PMC3507680,METHODS,paragraph,"OIR was induced in litters of C57/BL6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory), as previously described. Retinal neovascularization (NV) was induced in newborn mice as described previously. Briefly, P7 mice were exposed with their nursing mother, for 5 days (between P7 and P12) to hyperoxic conditions, by incubating them in an airtight chamber (PROOX 110 chamber O2 controller; Biospherix Ltd., Redfield, NY) ventilated by a mixture of O2 and air to a final oxygen fraction of 75±2%. These incubation conditions induced vaso-obliteration and subsequent cessation of vascular development in the capillary beds of the central retina. At P12, the mice were allowed to recover in normal room air conditions and maintained for another 5 days (till P17), the day in which peak disease occurs. A condition of relative hypoxia resulted between P12 and P17, and extensive retinal NV developed in 100% of the mice. Age-matched animals with the hyperoxia-exposed groups were maintained identically, except they were exposed to room air (21% O2, 79% N2) for the duration of the experiment. Animals were examined and sacrificed on the same days."
911,PMC3507680,METHODS,paragraph,Mice were treated in accordance with the recommendations of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) and all animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Mice were divided into four groups; (1) Non-treated mice grown under normoxic conditions; (2) non-treated hyperoxia-exposed mice; (3) DMSO- treated hyperoxia-exposed mice; and (4) YC-1-treated hyperoxia-exposed mice.

Non-treated mice grown under ambient conditions, non-treated hyperoxia-exposed mice, DMSO- treated hyperoxia-exposed mice and YC-1-treated hyperoxia-exposed mice, were all examined at different critical time points for qualitative assessment of the retinal vasculature by fluorescein angiography."
914,PMC3507680,METHODS,title_2,Immunohistochemistry
915,PMC3507680,METHODS,paragraph,"Mouse retinas were dissected and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS for 15 min at room temperature and embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 µm). Tissue sections were deparaffinized, hydrated, and later exposed to heat-induced antigen retrieval using a microwave oven (three 5-min cycles in citrate buffer, pH 6.0), endogenous peroxidase was abolished with methanol, and hydrogen peroxide and nonspecific background staining was blocked by incubating the tissue sections for 5 min in normal swine serum. Subsequently, all slides were washed three times in PBS, and incubated for 1 hr with primary anti–(ZnT-8 and β-actin) antibodies. Negative control experiments consisted of omission of the ZnT8 antibody and utilizing a rat anti-mouse IgG (isotype control antibody) as a replacement. The sections were washed with TBST and incubated with EnVision Polymer HRP secondary antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min. All slides were stained with DAB solution and counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were cover slipped (Permount; Fisher Scientific, Fairlawn, NJ) and examined by light microscopy. Negative controls included omission of the primary antibody or its substitution with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Sections were photographed under a microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 135, Thornwood, NY), and images were acquired a digital camera (AxioCam, NY). All retinas were examined at X60 objective. The staining intensity in our series ranged from a weak blush to moderate or strong. The amount of cells staining with the antibody was further categorized as focal (<10%), patchy (10%–50%), and diffuse/multifocal (>50%). For meaningful semiquantitative analysis, focal and/or weak staining was considered equivocal staining, and patchy or diffuse/multifocal staining was either subcategorized as either moderate or strong staining. All immunohistochemical analyses were measured by Metamorph digital image software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA)."
916,PMC3507680,METHODS,title_2,Immunohistochemical Image Analysis
917,PMC3507680,METHODS,paragraph,"ZnT8 positive immunostaining were captured using AxioCam digital microscope camera. MetaMorph image analysis was conducted by setting the filter with excitation wavelengths 488. MetaMorph image analysis software (version 7.1, Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) was used for image processing and quantitative analysis of ZnT8 positive immunostaining. MetaMorph tools were used to set the threshold and regions of interest (ROIs). All images were captured at identical time and exposure settings, and they were all processed to the same scale. Images were first segmented on the basis of pixel intensity, which was done on a plane-by-plane basis for an image stack. Briefly, each retinal section was scanned into Metamorph and five (5) fields/slide was chosen from each section for analysis. One hundred and fifty (150) cells from each field were selected. The saved file was used to calibrate each image for specific pixel size. With the help of a free drawing tool, ZnT8-stained areas were chosen and measured in total-pixels area. A threshold encompassing an intensity range of 100–250 gray-scale values was applied to the ROIs in the least brightly stained condition first. The data were also read and investigated by Matlab v6.5 script file software, which counted the total number of pixels that were above threshold value. This number was divided by the total number of pixels in each image to yield percent fluorescent pixels. To correct for background fluorescence, the threshold was adjusted for each experimental series, with concomitantly processed negative controls used as the guide for setting background fluorescence. The background fluorescence intensities per pixel were subtracted from the experimental data by using a one-step erosion procedure, and then all remaining objects were counted. The same threshold was subsequently applied to all images. ZnT8 was considered to be positive only when it exceeded the established threshold. Percent ZnT8 expression above threshold in the total area selected was then calculated. The total ZnT8 fluorescence intensity per cell was calculated, and the average fluorescence intensity per pixel was determined by dividing the total intensity by the area of the cell measured in pixels. This was followed by measuring the average fluorescence intensity in each field. Data from multiple fields as indicated over several experiments were used to obtain the final results. The number of immunopositive-stained cells per image was then expressed per um2, and the average number per section was determined among five separate fields."

By using the primers shown in Fig. 1A; our data revealed that there was a significant (**P<0.01) downregulation in the message levels in the non-treated oxygen-injured retinas (Fig. 1B: Red Bar) (2.96±0.02) and DMSO-treated retinas (Fig. 1B: Orange Bar) (3.08±0.01) as compared with the retinas from animals that were placed under ambient conditions (Fig. 1B: Blue Bar) and retinas from animals that were treated with 100 µM YC-1 (Fig. 1B: Green Bar).

924,PMC3507680,RESULTS,paragraph,"Our immunohistochemistry data have indicated that the ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the normoxic retinas exhibited the strongest ZnT8 immunoexpression, whereas the PRL, INL and IPL showed moderate ZnT8 staining (Fig.1C; 2A; 3A; 3B). Based on their location, these cells were presumed to be amacrine and horizontal cells. Furthermore, since both NFL and INL exhibited ZnT8 reactivity; this suggests that both the axons and dendrites of ganglion cells contain ZnT8. Our immunohistochemical data have also demonstrated that ischemic insult has mediated a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the protein level, in vivo (Fig. 2B; 3A; and 3B). The ZnT8-depleted cells were primarily localized in the photoreceptor layers/neurosensory retina (Fig. 2B; 2C). The nontreated O2-injured (Fig. 2B) and the DMSO-treated O2-injured retinas (Fig. 2C) exhibited a weak “focal”, sporadic staining signals for ZnT8 reactivity, which was primarily localized in the PRL, ONL, INL, GCL and the NFL regions. Ischemic injury has inflicted a significant (**P<0.01) downregulation of ZnT8 protein levels in the non-treated ischemic (5.38±20) as compared to normoxic retinas. In addition, ZnT8 expression was significantly (**P<0.01) downregulated in the DMSO-treated retinas (5.22±0.01) as compared with the retinas from animals that were placed under ambient conditions (Fig. 3B)."

Furthermore, YC-1 treatment restores the ZnT8 expression to basal homeostatic level, which was comparable to those of the nontreated normoxic retinas (Fig. 2D; 3A; 3B). YC-1-treated retinas displayed a significant upregulation in ZnT8 immunoexpression as compared to DMSO-treated retinas.

932,PMC3507680,RESULTS,paragraph,"Since the above data have revealed that ZnT8 was primarily expressed in the PRL, ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the normoxic and YC-1-treated retinas. Ergo in view of the fact that glial cells extend from the INL to the outer limiting membrane (OLM); the possibility existed that YC-1 maybe acting directly on retinal glial cells. We therefore, used rMC-1 cells (Müller cell line) to study the direct effects of YC-1 on ZnT8 mRNA expression. Real time RT PCR was employed to investigate the changes of ZnT8 mRNA expression in the Müller cells. Post-exposure to hypoxia for 48 hrs, rMC-1 cells (Fig. 4A: Red Bar) revealed statistically significant downregulation in ZnT8 mRNA level as compared to cells cultured under normoxia, which displayed high ZnT8 mRNA levels (Fig. 4A: Blue Bar). Under hypoxic conditions, the expression of ZnT8 was decreased by 3.1±0.7 folds, compared to normoxia. Treatment with DMSO did not influence the levels of ZnT8 expression (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar). The expression of ZnT8 in DMSO-treated rMC1 cells was 3.02±0.2 folds lower than normoxic controls (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar). Treatment of rMC1 with 25, 50, 75, and 100 µM YC-1 resulted in a significant dose-dependent upregulation of ZnT8 expression under hypoxia, as compared with the corresponding DMSO-treated hypoxic control cells (Fig. 4A: Green Bar). Data were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 4A, real-time PCR assay elucidated the expression of ZnT8 was significantly suppressed by hypoxic conditions, whereas the inhibitory effect was dramatically compromised and reversed in the presence of the HIF-1 inhibitor, YC-1. Taken together, our Real time RT-PCR data have revealed that post hypoxic exposure, the level of ZnT8 mRNA expression was significantly (***P<0.001) downregulated, as compared to the normoxic control (Fig. 4A: Red Bar). DMSO-treatment had no effect on the ZnT8 gene expression pattern in rMC-1 cells and it paralleled those in nontreated hypoxic cells (Fig. 4A: Orange Bar)."

934,PMC3507680,FIG,fig_caption,"rMC-1 cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The mRNA levels of ZnT8 were downregulated in non-treated hypoxic cells; while normoxic cells exhibited remarkable high mRNA levels. Treatment of hypoxic rMC-1 cells with various concentrations of YC-1 resulted in a significant upregulation of ZnT8 mRNA expression as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic cells. ANOVA was used for statistical analyses. Mean ± SEM of mRNA level normalized to β-actin were calculated, (***P<0.001 and **P<0.01 as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic control). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (A). The protein expression levels of ZnT8 were significantly elevated in the normoxic cells, as compared to cells that were exposed to hypoxic conditions. In YC-1-treated hypoxic cells, ZnT8 protein expression was significantly increased in a dose-dependent fashion, compared with DMSO-treated hypoxic cells, which exhibited a significant ZnT8 downregulation. Statistical significance was determined by ANOVA (**P<0.01). Data are representative of 3 independent experiments (B).

935,PMC3507680,RESULTS,paragraph,"Western immunoblot analysis was performed. rMC-1 cells cultured under normoxia exhibited high signals of ZnT8, while this signal was downregulated after 48 hrs of hypoxic exposure as compared to normoxic control (Fig. 4B). In the DMSO-treated hypoxic cells, ZnT8 protein expression profile was compatible to the ZnT8 expression that was characterized in non-treated hypoxic cells. YC-1 treatment induced an augmentation in the hypoxia-downregulated ZnT8 protein levels in a concentration-dependent fashion, as compared to DMSO-treated hypoxic cells (Fig. 4B and 4C). In the DMSO-treated cells, ZnT8 protein levels remained comparable to non-treated cells that were cultured under hypoxic conditions. Since YC-1 treatment did not inhibit β-actin, this indicates that YC-1 influence on ZnT8 protein expression was specific. Our densitometry analysis indicated that ZnT8 protein expression was significantly downregulated in hypoxic cells, as compared to cells incubated under normoxic conditions (Fig. 4C). Direct measurements of protein levels by Western blot indicated that under hypoxic conditions; ZnT8 protein expression was significantly decreased by 10 fold, compared to normoxia; whereas treatment with 100 µM significantly upregulated ZnT8 expression by 8 folds in rMC-1 cells, compared to non-treated hypoxic cells, (***P<0.001) (Fig. 4C)."

937,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"It has been determined that Zn++ dyshomeostasis, both systemically and in the pancreas, plays an intricate role in the pathology of both, T1DM) and T2DM. Severe Zn++ deficiency induces hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, directly implicating Zn++ in systemic glucose regulation. Consistent with a role for Zn++ in glycemic dysregulation, Zinc supplementation ameliorates some physiological symptoms of DM."
938,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of blindness world-wide. In this study, we have employed the OIR mouse model for various reasons: 1) This model depicts the human retinopathy of prematurity (ROP); 2) It represents an ischemia-dependent model, which manifests the overexpression of HIF-1, the main causation of retinal ischemia; 3) It manifests retinal vasculopathy, i.e., the development of retinal NV; 4) Ischemia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of age related macular degeneration (AMD). Recent findings strongly suggest that ischemia and vascular impairment play a central role in the etiology of AMD; 5) Most importantly, zinc deficiency is highly associated with retinal pathologies that are induced by retinal ischemia. There is hoarding evidence, which indicate that zinc deficiency in the retina contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD. It has been suggested that replenishing zinc by oral administration had a positive effect on AMD patients by slowing down the progress of the dry form of the disease. These findings support the view that zinc deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of AMD. The 2004 AREDS report and other studies confirm that replacing zinc with a dietary supplement has beneficial effects against AMD. Therefore, the Zn-AMD connection suggests that the risk for or severity of AMD increases with the depletion of available intracellular zinc pools in the retina.Hypoxia inducible factor members have been implicated in regulating the angiogenic and metabolic response to ischemia. HIF-1α is known to exist in subretinal NV and hypoxia is the main inducer for the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). It has been reported that zinc hampers hypoxia-stimulated HIF-1 activation in astrocytes by inhibiting nuclear HIF-1α translocation and subsequently disrupting HIF-1 heterodimerization. Zinc inhibited HIF-1α recruitment onto VEGF promoter and the zinc-induced suppression of HIF-1-dependent activation of VEGF. Of note is the finding that zinc also inhibited HIF-2α other than HIF-1α; this is highly relevant in light of the fact that recent studies have shown that HIF-2α may be the main regulator of long term (chronic) hypoxic gene expression."
939,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In order to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that influence the expression of ZnT8 under ischemic conditions; we have utilized the mouse model of OIR. This model has been widely used in studies related to proliferative DR, ROP, and in studies evaluating the efficacy of antiangiogenic compounds. In the retina, hypoxia may occur as a result of vascular disruption caused by various pathologies, such as hyperglycemia in DM, thrombosis in vein occlusions or developmental delays in ROP. Furthermore, hypoxia/ischemia are the key driving force inducing a vascular response, whereby insufficiently perfused tissue is revascularised by the sprouting of new capillaries from pre-existing vessels. However, this revascularization condition is sometimes not successful, leading to the formation of abnormal vessels–so-called ‘neovascularization’. NV is major vision-threatening sequelae in many ischemic retinopathies because of the abnormal vascular leakage, which cause edema and exert tractional forces that untimely cause retinal detachment. It is therefore, tentative to speculate that ischemic vascular disease in the retina may either leave retina permanently ischemic with slow degradation of vision, or alternatively lead to proliferative vascular disease, which can also destroy vision. It has been shown that low concentrations of zinc were neuroprotective in the retina. Is has been demonstrated that the “muffler model” estimated the resting intracellular free Zn++ concentration to be 1.07 nM, whereas excursions above or below that level may have detrimental effects."
940,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Ischemia is a crucial component of DR. A plethora of reports have addressed ischemic retinopathy and the role in which ZnT8 play in DM. However, the link between ZnT8 and ischemic retinopathy has not been defined yet. Our current investigation also highlights the neuroprotective effects of YC-1. Previously, we have reported the pleiortropic effects of YC-1 on various hypoxia/ischemia-induced retinal pathologies. These investigations have concluded that YC-1 targets several antiangiogenic properties in the ischemic retina, via various mechanisms, which were mainly centered on the; (1) suppression the HIF-1α protein levels, accumulation, and stability; (2) blocking the HIF-1α nuclear shuttling mechanism; (3) promoting the HIF-1α proteasomal degradation; (4) inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor-2 α (HIF-2α), VEGF, erythropoietin (EPO), enodthelin-1 (ET-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at the message and the protein levels. Furthermore, our current sequence analysis of ZnT8 indicates the presence of a hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter region of ZnT8. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that HIF-1α (or possibly HIF-2α) overexpression notably suppresses ZnT8 expression, whereas the inhibition of HIF-1α (or possibly HIF-2α) by YC-1 rescues the injured retina by upregulating the ZnT8 levels. It has been demonstrated that levels of platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) were increased after ischemic injury. Our studies have previously demonstrated that YC-1 reversed reactive gliosis during ischemic retinal injury via impairing the expression of PDGF-B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in glial cells."
941,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"It has been shown that YC-1 had protective effects against sodium nitroprusside-mediated apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells. Additionally, it’s been reported that YC-1 protected the white matter axons against damage by ischemia. Studies have indicated that YC-1 was neuroprotective in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line against damage caused by MPP+ or 6-OHDA. Moreover, YC-1 was able to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and nuclear factor kappa-b (NFκB) activation, indicating that YC-1 may be developed as an anti-inflammatory neuroprotective agent."
942,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our investigation emphasizes the potential neuroprotective effects of YC-1. It has been demonstrated the antiapoptotic effects of NO are mediated, in part, by cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) and downstream target protein kinase G (PKG). Furthermore, it has been reported that nitric oxide (NO) serves as neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator in the central and peripheral nervous systems and certain neuronal cells. At low physiological concentrations, NO can act as an antiapoptotic/prosurvival factor in neural cells. It has been revealed that NO-cGMP-PKG signaling pathway was crucially involved in the learning enhancement of YC-1 and appeared to play an essential role in preventing the activation of a proapoptotic pathway, thus promoting neural cell survival. In addition, in rat astrocytes, YC-1 analogs attenuated H2O2-induced effects, and demonstrated their neuroprotective effects against cellular injury in cortical neurons. The neuroprotective properties of these analogs may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and stroke. However, further studies are necessary to determine the exact mechanism by which YC-1 form confers neuroprotection. In the current study, we show for the first time the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina. Here we show for the first time the expression profile of ZnT8 in the retina. The ONL, OPL, GCL, and NFL tissue layers of the retina exhibited the strongest ZnT8 expression, whereas the PRL, INL and IPL showed moderate ZnT8 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that hypoxic/ischemic insult has mediated a significant downregulation of ZnT8 at the message and protein levels, in vitro and in vivo. The ZnT8-depleted cells were primarily localized in the photoreceptor layers/neurosensory retina. Our data also suggest that a treatment with YC-1, a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1, at a concentration of 100 µM on P12 and P15, rescues the injured retina by restoring the ZnT8 expression to basal homeostatic level, which was comparable to those of the nontreated normoxic retinas. It is noteworthy that although YC-1 inhibition of HIF-1 seems to rescue the ischemia-induced retinal damage, and despite the plethora of published literature available showing the beneficial outcomes of inhibiting HIF-1; several studies have indicated that inhibition of HIF-1 is detrimental during ischemic or hypoxic injury. These studies have demonstrated that during diabetic complications, the cellular response to hypoxia has been shown to be impaired, and hyperglycemia appears to be the critical event implicated in such deregulation, most likely as a result of destabilization of HIF-1. Hence, impairment of the regulation of HIF-1 may have several deleterious consequences for cell and tissue adaptation and survival at low oxygen levels. This apparent anomaly is difficult to reconcile but possibly related to different experimental models. Taken together, this study extends the possible use of YC-1 as a therapeutic agent in through its effect on Zn++ homeostasis. Combined with our in vivo finding; our data raises the possibility that under ischemic conditions, glial cells are the predominant source of ZnT8, and YC-1 may be upregulating ZnT8 expression by acting directly on retinal glial cells. Moreover, our data raise an interesting possibility that glial malfunction may play a crucial role in the molecular mechanism(s), which links DM and ischemic retinopathy through the expression of ZnT-8. Whether the reduced expression of ZnT8 is paralleled by significant changes in Zn++ homeostasis is yet to be determined. This can be revealed through experiments measuring the intracellular Zn++ directly. In addition, ZnT8 knockout animals might prove very useful in addressing this issue. It is however likely, that since the zinc role is intimately linked to AMD, which is an ocular pathology that is manifested during oxygen-induced retinopathy; the possibility exists that reduced ZnT8 expression in our model might be reflected by the significant changes in Zn++ homeostasis due to ischemic insults. Moreover, since ZnT8 is responsible for transporting Zn++ from the cytosol to the intra-cellular vesicles, it is highly possible that reduced ZnT8 expression may lead to the accumulation of Zn++ in the cytosol; hence induce toxicity. This might be supported by the findings of other studies, which demonstrated that in pressure-induced ischemia; zinc has been shown to be toxic and therefore, endogenous zinc may contribute to ischemic neuronal death in the retina."
943,PMC3507680,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our data have indicated that treatment with YC-1, a small molecule inhibitor of HIF-1 reversed the decreased ZnT8 expression levels, in vivo and in vitro. This investigation suggests that YC-1 may play a crucial neuroprotective role against ischemic insult. However, we should highlight that future studies should possibly address the use of different HIF-1 inhibitors in order to solidify our findings."

956,PMC3732288,TITLE,front,Placental Growth Factor Expression Is Required for Bone Marrow Endothelial Cell Support of Primitive Murine Hematopoietic Cells
957,PMC3732288,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Two distinct microenvironmental niches that regulate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell physiology in the adult bone marrow have been proposed; the endosteal and the vascular niche. While extensive studies have been performed relating to molecular interactions in the endosteal niche, the mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell interaction with bone marrow endothelial cells are less well defined. Here we demonstrate that endothelial cells derived from the bone marrow supported hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells to a higher degree than other endothelial or stromal cell populations. This support was dependant upon placental growth factor expression, as genetic knockdown of mRNA levels reduced the ability of endothelial cells to support hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of recovery from radiation induced myelosuppression, we demonstrate that bone marrow endothelial cells were able to augment the recovery of the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. However, this effect was diminished when the same cells with reduced placental growth factor expression were administered, possibly owing to a reduced homing of the cells to the bone marrow vasculature. Our data suggest that placental growth factor elaborated from bone marrow endothelial cells mediates the regulatory effects of the vascular niche on hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell physiology."
958,PMC3732288,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
959,PMC3732288,INTRO,paragraph,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are maintained, and their physiology regulated, in specialized microenvironments known as the stem cell niche. In the adult bone marrow (BM) two different stem cell niches have been proposed; the endosteal niche, where the osteoblasts are believed to maintain the quiescence and promote self-renewal of HSCs, and the vascular niche, where cells of the endothelial lineage or perivascular cells support the HSCs. While many studies have been performed that examined the molecular and cellular interactions between the stem cells and the endosteal niche cells, little is know regarding the interactions between the stem cells and the cell types that comprise the vascular niche."
960,PMC3732288,INTRO,paragraph,"It has been shown that 60% of HSCs in the adult BM are in contact with sinusoidal endothelium, while only 14% are at the endosteal surface. However, it is not known if direct contact with endothelial cells (ECs) in the vascular niche is required for self-renewal of HSCs as the mechanisms for the support remain relatively unknown. Previous studies examined the ability of primary adult mice ECs from non-hematopoietic organs such as heart, brain, liver, lung and kidney to support hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC). Using in vitro co-culture assays as well as in vivo competitive repopulation assays, these studies demonstrated differences in the supportive ability of the ECs, as brain and heart ECs could expand the HSC population, while lung and liver ECs maintained the hematopoietic cells. However, the mechanism of support was not addressed. Bis, an anti-apoptotic and stress response protein, has been identified as an important protein for the vascular niche with Bis−/− mice demonstrating a defect in sinusoidal endothelium, as well as a loss of stromal cells expressing CXCL-12 or IL-7. Yet, the specific mechanisms directly influencing the HSCs are not known. Similarly, pleiotrophin (PTN) has been proposed as a secreted component of the BM vascular niche as PTN−/− mice demonstrated a reduction in BM HSCs. But these effects were only correlated with an expression of PTN in BM ECs."
961,PMC3732288,INTRO,paragraph,"Recently, a functional regulatory effect of ECs on HSCs has been reported. Here, a primary human EC line expressing the adenoviral E4ORF1 gene could promote self-renewal of murine LT-HSCs in vitro which could thus augment BM repopulation in vivo. The mechanism of action was related to the Notch pathway as Notch ligand expression on the BMECs promoted expansion of LT-HSCs in vivo. The relevance of these studies to the in vivo setting is unknown as the ECs were of human origin and the support of murine HSCs was investigated. However, the authors have recently further expanded these observations to demonstrate that human CD34+ cells co-cultured on these ECs are able to expand their in vivo repopulation potential compared to cells cultured in cytokines alone. More recent investigations into the mechanisms of support of primitive HSCs by ECs have came from Ding and colleagues who specifically deleted stem cell factor (SCF) from various proposed components of the niche and examined the effects on the primitive cells. Here, they showed that SCF expression from ECs is essential for HSC function, while deletion of expression from other stromal cell types in the BM does not affect the primitive hematopoietic cells. Similar studies from the same group, as well as another independent group, have also found that deletion of CXCL12 from endothelial cells led to a specific decline in HSC number or function in the adult BM. However, in all of these studies, direct interactions between the HSCs and the ECs themselves were not addressed."
962,PMC3732288,INTRO,paragraph,"We wished to determine which specific cells of the murine BM vascular niche plays a predominant role in controlling HSPC physiology, and the mechanism by which the vascular niche may directly exert its effects. Previous studies have suggested that HSPCs isolated from different regions of the BM microenvironment have different biological potentials. We hypothesized that niche-related elements contributed to these effects and therefore examined whether the ECs comprising the vascular niche derived from different regions of the BM have differing effects on the regulation of HSPCs. We demonstrated that central marrow ECs showed enhanced support of HSPC growth in vitro. This correlated with expression of placental growth factor (PlGF), a factor which has been shown to be essential for the recovery of the hematopoietic system following BM myelosuppression. Using genetic knockdown strategies, we demonstrate a role for PlGF in the support of primitive cells in vitro. Further, by using an in vivo model of recovery from radiation induced myelosuppression, we demonstrate that by transplanting central marrow EC to sublethally irradiated mice, the recovery from myelosuppression was accelerated. However this effect was abrogated upon administration of PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs."

The mice were then sacrificed on day 5, and the frequency of labeled cells was measured by the detection of CFDA-SE+ cells in the BM and spleen by flow cytometry. To assess the lodgment of injected cells to bone marrow, the tibias from the Balb/c mice were dissected on day 5 after irradiation, decalcified for 3 days in Immunocal (Decal Chemical Corporation), and embedded in paraffin blocks after processing. 5 µm serial sections of tibia were cut and mounted with Vectashield containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories)."

998,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"BM MNCs were isolated from central marrow or endosteal marrow, and grown in either endothelial or stromal cell culture conditions. ECs from the spleen were also cultured as a comparison with the BM derived ECs. In these experiments, the five types of cultured cells; central marrow derived ECs, endosteal marrow derived ECs, spleen derived ECs, central marrow derived SCs and endosteal marrow derived SCs, were characterized for endothelial specific markers. The cells in endothelial culture conditions presented typical endothelial cobblestone morphology after reaching confluence, while the cells in the stromal culture conditions showed spindle-shape cells and lacked the cobblestone morphology (data not shown). The mRNA expression level of endothelial related genes, Tie-2 and VE-cadherin, were significantly higher in the central marrow derived ECs and spleen ECs, while the expression in endosteal marrow ECs was only marginally greater than either stromal cell culture (Figure 1A, B). To further examine the endothelial phenotype, endothelial specific markers including CD31 and VE-cadherin were evaluated in the cultured cells by fluorescence immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Cells grown in all EC culture conditions expressed CD31 and VE-cadherin, but the central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs did not (Figure 1C). The percentage of expression of CD31 or VE-cadherin in the ECs was about 40%–50%. When the ECs were detached from the culture flasks using a cell dissociation solution treatment instead of the trypsin-EDTA, a much higher level of ECs was detected in EC cultures derived from central marrow, endosteal marrow and spleen as compared to central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 1D). The cells in the ECs culture condition also had the ability to take up DiI-Ac-LDL and form capillary-like tubes in Matrigel. To evaluate the composition of non-endothelial cells in the stromal and endothelial culture conditions, we assessed the level of osteoblasts. Osteoblasts are one of the components of primary bone marrow stromal cells, and characterized by the expression of alkaline phosphatase activity. We observed no, or very few, ALP+ cells in the central marrow and spleen derived ECs cultures. However, the cells in the endosteal marrow derived ECs culture condition contained about 10% ALP positive cells. The higher proportion of ALP+ cells (40%–50%) were observed in the central marrow and endosteal marrow derived SCs culture condition as compared to the cells in the ECs culture condition (Figure 1E). Therefore, highly EC enriched primary cultures were used in these experiments."

1001,PMC3732288,RESULTS,title_2,Central marrow ECs demonstrated enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cells
1002,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"We next assessed the ability of the five types of cultured cells to maintain primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro using the functional CAFC assay. The CAFC frequency at shorter (days 14) and longer (days 28–49) time intervals was used to measure relatively mature and primitive hematopoietic cells, respectively. As shown in Figure 2A, the frequencies of short-term (day 14) and long-term (day 35) CAFCs of BM MNCs on central marrow EC and endosteal marrow EC were higher compared with those on spleen EC, central marrow SC or endosteal marrow SC. The CAFC frequencies of BM MNCs on central marrow EC and endosteal marrow EC from day 14 to day 35 were similar, but these two curves diverged at culture times after day 35. On day 49 of culture, CAFCs were detectable only on central marrow ECs. We further compared the effects of central marrow ECs and central marrow SCs to support the primitive hematopoietic cell activity of purified lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells. The CAFC activity in the LSK cells subpopulation on the central marrow ECs were significantly higher than that on the central marrow SCs at day 14 and day 35 (Figure 2B). These data indicate that central marrow or endosteal marrow derived ECs have enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cell growth over spleen derived ECs and BM derived SCs. In addition, central marrow ECs are capable of maintaining primitive hematopoietic cell activity for longer time intervals over the other supportive layers."

1005,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"In order to determine the effect of the five types of cultured cells on the proliferation and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells, we measured the number of CD45+ hematopoietic cells and CFU-C activity, following a 7 day co-culture of LSK cells. We found that the central marrow ECs could promote the proliferation of CD45+ hematopoietic cells by 2 to 15 fold higher than other types of supportive cells (Figure 2C). In addition, the generation of CFU-Cs on central marrow ECs was significantly higher than that on other supportive layers (Figure 2D). These results demonstrated that central marrow ECs are superior in their ability of promoting proliferation and differentiation of primitive hematopoietic cells than other feeder layers. Interestingly, spleen ECs were able to support the proliferation and differentiation of the primitive hematopoietic cells (Figure 2C, D), but were not able to support more primitive CAFCs (Figure 2A)."
1006,PMC3732288,RESULTS,title_2,PlGF expression is specifically higher in the central marrow ECs
1007,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"Recent studies have suggested that VEGF-A and PlGF may be important cytokines involved in the reciprocal interaction between primitive hematopoietic cells and ECs. Therefore, we postulated that VEGF-family factors secreted from ECs may act upon the primitive hematopoietic cells to regulate their physiology. To examine the mechanism of enhanced support of primitive hematopoietic cells by the central marrow ECs, we performed real-time PCR analysis for the expression of VEGFa, VEGFb and PlGF. The five types of cultured cells expressed VEGFa at very similar levels (Figure 3B). VEGFb expression in cultured central marrow ECs was higher than cultured endosteal marrow ECs, cultured central marrow SCs and cultured endosteal marrow SCs, but the expression was similar to cultured spleen ECs (Figure 3C). In contrast, the expression of PlGF was significantly higher specifically in the cultured central marrow ECs compared with the other types of cultured cells (Figure 3D). In addition, we examined the expression of VEGFa, VEGFb and PlGF in freshly isolated central marrow ECs, endosteal marrow ECs, spleen ECs, central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3A). Albeit at a much lower level, in contrast to the cultured cells, VEGFa expression in freshly sorted ECs derived from central marrow, spleen and endosteal marrow was higher than the central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3B), whereas the expression of VEGFb in freshly sorted ECs and SCs was similar (Figure 3C). However, correlating with the cultured cells, the expression of PlGF in the freshly sorted central marrow ECs and endosteal marrow ECs was higher than the spleen ECs, central marrow SCs and endosteal marrow SCs (Figure 3D). These results suggest that PlGF was predominantly expressed on endothelial cells but not on stromal cells in the mouse BM. Therefore, due to this high expression in the cultured central marrow ECs, we hypothesized that PlGF may mediate the supportive role of these cells on primitive hematopoietic cells."

1010,PMC3732288,RESULTS,title_2,Reduced PlGF expression in central marrow ECs diminishes their ability to support primitive hematopoietic cells
1011,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"To determine whether the increased expression of PlGF plays a functional role in the support of the primitive hematopoietic cells, we used a genetic ‘knockdown’ approach to reduce PlGF gene expression in the cultured central marrow ECs. Anti-PlGF shRNA vectors were transduced into central marrow ECs and PlGF expression was quantified using quantitative RT-PCR. We found that among five different shRNA vectors, E8 and E12, as well as their combination, significantly reduced PlGF expression compared to control cells (Figure 4A). To exclude the possibility that reduction of PlGF grossly altered the properties of the ECs, we examined the characteristics of ECs before and after PlGF knockdown. We found that PlGF knockdown central marrow EC took up Ac-LDL uniformly as well as non-transduced central marrow EC (Figure 4B). Additionally, PlGF knockdown central marrow EC formed capillary-like tubules within 5–16 hours when plated on Matrigel (Figure 4C). Analysis of the average length of the endothelial tubules demonstrated that there was no significant difference between the control and the PlGF knockdown cells (278 μm +/−50 µm versus 267 μm +/−94 μm, respectively). These results demonstrated that PlGF knockdown central marrow EC retained endothelial characteristics. To directly evaluate the ability of these cells to support primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro, LSK cells were seeded on central marrow ECs transduced with E8, E12 and E8+E12. We found that there was an significant inhibition of long term (day 35) CAFCs activity on PlGF shRNA transduced central marrow ECs compared with the mock transduced central marrow ECs and non-transduced central marrow ECs (Figure 4D). These results suggested that PlGF is involved in the supportive effect of central marrow ECs on primitive hematopoietic cells in vitro."

1014,PMC3732288,RESULTS,title_2,Knockdown of PlGF expression in central marrow ECs inhibits recovery of primitive hematopoietic cells in vivo
1015,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"Previous studies have demonstrated that following sub-lethal irradiation, mice injected with murine fetal blood ECs displayed accelerated recovery of hematopoiesis with essentially normal BM sinusoid vessel architecture recovery by day 20 following irradiation. To investigate whether PlGF is involved in this process, we transplanted central marrow ECs, PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs, central marrow SCs or PBS into Balb/c mice that were irradiated with 550cGy and evaluated the recovery of the hematopoietic system at day 20 post-irradiation. Sca-1 is not informative as an HSPC marker in Balb/c mice, therefore this was excluded from the analysis of the primitive hematopoietic cells. We identified Lin−c-Kit+CD150+CD48− cells as LT-HSCs, Lin−c-Kit+CD150−CD48− cells as ST-HSCs and Lin−c-Kit+ cells as hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). The frequency of LT-HSCs was significantly increased in the central marrow EC treated mice, but not PlGF knockdown EC or central marrow SC treated mice compared to PBS treated controls. Similarly, the frequency of HPCs was significantly increased in the central marrow EC treated mice, but not in PlGF knockdown EC or central marrow SC treated mice (Figure 5A). The frequency of ST-HSCs in the central marrow EC treated mice suggested an increase, but was not significantly different (Figure 5A). To assess the function of the primitive hematopoietic cells, we performed CAFC assays. We found that the frequency of day 14 and day 35 CAFCs from central marrow EC treated mice were significantly higher than that from PlGF knockdown central marrow EC or PBS treated mice (Figure 5B). The frequency of CAFC in central marrow stromal cells demonstrated an increase at day 14, but no difference at day 35 compared with PBS treated mice (Figure 5B). These results demonstrated that, similar to previous reports, the administration of central marrow ECs were able to accelerate the recovery of hematopoiesis, however reduction of PlGF expression in the same cells abrogated this effect."

To characterize the degree of regenerating sinusoid vessels, we quantified morphologically normal vessels and pathologic vessels, presenting as dilated or discontinuous vessels based on the VE-Cadherin+ BM ECs (Figure 6B). We observed a predominance of pathologic vessels in PBS, central marrow SC and PlGF knockdown central marrow EC treated mice. However, in central marrow EC treated mice there was significant vascular recovery (Figure 6C). Furthermore, we examined the frequency of ECs in BM, defined as CD31+CD45−Ter119−, and found that the frequency of these cells in the BM of central marrow EC treated mice was significantly higher than the other treated mice (Figure 6D). These results indicated that the administration of central marrow ECs were able to augment the replenishment of BM vasculature.

1022,PMC3732288,RESULTS,title_2,Transplanted central marrow ECs contributed to the BM vasculature recovery in irradiated mice
1023,PMC3732288,RESULTS,paragraph,"To determine whether the transplanted central marrow ECs were directly incorporated into the reconstituting vasculature of the BM, central marrow ECs and SCs were labeled with CFDA-SE and injected into the irradiated mice. Our results demonstrate that the central marrow ECs had a greater frequency of homing to BM and spleen compared with central marrow SCs as assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 7A). A reduced homing level of PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs in BM, but similar homing level in spleen, was detected compared to the mock transduced central marrow ECs (Figure 7A). With respect to lodgment of the central marrow ECs, histologic assessment of the tibias showed that the 37.5% CFDA-SE+ cells were contiguous with the vascular endothelium (Figure 7B top), while 62.5% CFDA-SE+ cells were within the BM space (Figure 7B bottom). CFDA-SE+ cells were not detected in the BM of the mice treated with PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs or central marrow SCs (data not shown). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the cultured central marrow ECs were capable of homing to BM and lodging in the BM vascular niche, which presumably led to augmented recovery of hematopoiesis and the vasculature in BM of the irradiated mice. While the PlGF knockdown central marrow ECs were able to home to the spleen similar to the controls, they had a specific defect in homing to the vasculature structures of the BM. Therefore, PlGF may play a role in the recovery of hematopoiesis through multiple different mechanisms involving direct effects of the HSPCs, as well as interactions with other BMECs. These studies thus highlight the challenge of separating direct effects of ECs on the primitive hematopoietic cells and on the vasculature, which may in turn affect the HSPCs."

1026,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
1027,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Initial studies of the HSC niche focused on the endosteal and vascular niche as being distinct entities, with the endosteal niche supporting the LT-HSCs, while the vascular niche supports ST-HSCs. More recent data has suggested that they may be indistinct and that both the osteoblasts and EC play key roles, potentially in the same niche. However, the question still remains as to what role the EC is playing in the niche and what are the molecular signals by which it exerts its effects. In addition, while cells of the osteoblast lineage are specifically localized to the endosteal surface, ECs are found in different regions of the BM. Whether these ECs in different regions of the BM differentially regulate HSPCs has not been explored."
1028,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,paragraph,"ECs are known to release angiocrine factors, such as growth factors or chemokines, which promote organogenesis and cell differentiation. These angiocrine factors are also known to affect hematopoiesis. Recently, it has been reported that angiocrine expression of the Notch ligands Jagged 1 and Jagged 2 on human ECs is necessary for the support of LT-HSCs. VEGF is known to regulate HSC repopulation and survival, as well as coordinate with Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) to induce mobilization of HSCs by temporal and regional activation of VEGF/VEGFR2 and Ang-1/Tie-2 signaling pathways. In addition, PlGF promoted recruitment of VEGFR1+ HSCs from a quiescent to a proliferative BM microenvironment, favoring differentiation, mobilization and reconstitution of hematopoiesis."
1029,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We compared the effects of ECs or SCs isolated from the endosteal or central region of the BM, or the spleen on the support of growth of HSPCs in vitro to mimic the complexity of the BM microenvironment in vivo. We demonstrated that the ECs from the BM were superior in their ability to maintain primitive hematopoietic cells, with the central marrow ECs showing enhanced support at longer time intervals. In addition, central marrow ECs supported increased proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells. We also found that the expression of PlGF was significantly increased in the central marrow ECs compared to other supportive cells. This effect of central marrow ECs on supporting primitive hematopoietic cells growth in vitro was diminished when expression of PlGF was knocked down. Hence, we proposed that secreted PlGF from BM ECs may influence the physiology of HSCs, although we could not rule out an autocrine action on the ECs themselves as well."
1030,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,paragraph,"While it has been shown that osteoblasts are key constituents of the HSC niche under homeostatic conditions, it has been proposed that they do not play a role in hematopoietic reconstitution after myeloablation, rather this is the role of the ECs. In our in vivo model of recovery from radiation induced myeloablation, different cell populations were transplanted into sublethally irradiated mice. It has been shown that transplanted ECs do not engraft in the BM, however, peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver or lung derived ECs have also been isolated in vitro and the transplanted ECs could restore impaired neovascularization in a hind limb ischemia or myocardial ischemia model. In our study the transplanted BM ECs were able to home and lodge in the BM, either at or adjacent to the vasculature. They also had a positive effect on the recovery of hematopoiesis as evidenced by an increased frequency of primitive hematopoietic cells. These effects were specific for ECs, since the transplanted BM SCs were only able to induce HPC recovery, as assessed by the week 2 CAFC assay, and were not detected in BM. Correlating with the in vitro assays, knockdown of PlGF expression in the BM ECs reduced the effect down to no cell treatment levels. However, these effects may be simply due to a lack of homing of the cells specifically to the BM vasculature. This highlights a complicating factor in these studies, which is that the effect of PlGF was to also stimulate normal sinusoid vessel recovery, potentially through the specific migration of the ECs to the bone marrow endothelium. Therefore, as is the case in many studies of the vascular niche, separating direct effects on the primitive hematopoietic cells from effects on the vasculature which may then further promote the reconstitution of the HSPCs becomes challenging."
1031,PMC3732288,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Taken together, our data demonstrate that ECs in the BM vascular niche are involved in the regeneration of HSPCs and that PlGF plays a role in this overall process. Whether or not this mechanism is also involved in the regulation of HSC self-renewal and quiescence at the endosteal surface was not addressed, but it is possible that different mechanisms may occur here. Future studies may be required to delineate the potential role of different HSC niches in the bone marrow and how they regulate hematopoiesis as a whole."

1045,PMC3770514,TITLE,front,Nicotinamide-functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes increase insulin production in pancreatic beta cells via MIF pathway
1046,PMC3770514,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Recent data in the literature support the role of nicotinamide (NA) as a pharmacologic agent that stimulates pancreatic beta-cells to produce insulin in vitro. There are data showing that carbon nanotubes may be useful in initiating and maintaining cellular metabolic responses. This study shows that administration of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with nicotinamide (NA-MWCNTs) leads to significant insulin production compared with individual administration of NA, MWCNTs, and a control solution. Treatment of 1.4E7 cells for 30 minutes with NA-MWCNTs at concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 20 mg/L resulted in significantly increased insulin release (0.18 ± 0.026 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.21 ± 0.024 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.27 ± 0.028 ng/mL for 20 mg/L). Thus, compared with cells treated with NA only (0.1 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.12 ± 0.017 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.17 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 20 mg/L) we observed a significant positive effect on insulin release in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs. The results were confirmed using flow cytometry, epifluorescence microscopy combined with immunochemistry staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques. In addition, using immunofluorescence microscopy techniques, we were able to demonstrate that MWCNTs enhance insulin production via the macrophage migration inhibitory factor pathway. The application and potential of NA combined with MWCNTs as an antidiabetic agent may represent the beginning of a new chapter in the nanomediated treatment of diabetes mellitus."
1047,PMC3770514,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1048,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Over the past three decades, the number of patients with diabetes mellitus has more than doubled globally, making diabetes one of the most important public health challenges for all nations. A 2011 report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately one million Americans have type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes is the most common childhood metabolic disease."
1049,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Currently, insulin replacement is the first-line treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes and severe forms of type 2 diabetes. Treatment by insulin injection is generally effective but nonphysiologic, and has the major disadvantage of producing chronic complications. On the other hand, islet transplantation can maintain normoglycemia without hypoglycemic side effects, with the major clinical impact of releasing diabetics from insulin dependence. However, the transplanted islets tend to lose their functional ability over time."
1050,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Therefore, while allotransplantation or xenotransplantation still imposes important problems, the use of tumoral B-cell lines could be a potential solution, especially given that various neoplastic cell lines have demonstrated changes characteristic of differentiation after treatment with specific chemical agents. Hence, sodium butyrate increased the transcription of the glucagon and insulin genes in rat insulinoma cells, suggesting that these cells acquired more differentiated characteristics. Moreover, clones displaying the most appropriate patterns of insulin secretion can be selected and amplified at low cost, thus providing a method of producing pure insulin-secreting cells with applications in the study of pancreatic cell biology. However, in addition to retaining their neoplastic nature and presenting primitive differentiating features of the parent cells, the bulk of these cell lines progressively lose their insulin biosynthesis and regulated secretion with successive numbers of passages."
1051,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Despite good progress, several obstacles remain to be overcome before insulin-producing cell transplantation can be translated into a therapy for human patients. The evidence suggests that nicotinamide (NA), a derivative of nicotinic acid, has many effects on beta-cell survival and functions, by acting as a free radical scavenger or as a precursor for NA adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NA is also an inhibitor of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) synthetase, a chromatin-associated enzyme involved in cellular DNA repair and differentiation which, if activated during DNA repair synthesis, could lead to a critical decrease in NAD levels in beta-cells. The activity of poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) synthetase is linked with the level of cellular differentiation in several cell types. Further, it has been postulated that poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) synthetase inhibitors, such as NA, may counteract suppression of beta-cell DNA replication, thus inducing beta-cell regeneration."
1052,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"NA has also been reported to affect insulin production and cell proliferation in adult mouse islets in culture and following transplantation. Moreover, increases in insulin production and content of cultured fetal pig islet-like cell clusters have been seen as a consequence of beta-cell neoformation through differentiation. Hence, in stem cell research, several protocols have used NA as a differentiation factor."
1053,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Preliminary data from the literature support the involvement of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in stimulating insulin secretion. This implication is supported by the fact that, as shown by immunocytochemistry, MIF and insulin colocalize within the secretory granules of the pancreatic islet beta-cells, and once released, MIF appears to regulate insulin release in an autocrine fashion. MIF is also highly expressed in several insulin-secreting cell lines, and its production is regulated by glucose in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner."
1054,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have many unique physical, mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties, and have been intensively explored for biological and biomedical applications in the past few years. Extensive reports have explored CNTs as potential drug carriers and delivery vehicles. CNTs can be functionalized with pharmacologically active biomolecules by forming stable covalent bonds or supramolecular assemblies based on noncovalent interactions. Once the cargos are delivered into various cells, they are able to overexpress their physiologic functions."
1055,PMC3770514,INTRO,paragraph,"Considering all these data, we hypothesized that combined administration of both NA and CNTs would function as powerful nanobiosystems to improve the capacity of insulin-producing cells to generate and release insulin. This study shows that administration of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with nicotinamide (NA-MWCNTs) leads to significant insulin production and glucose-induced insulin secretion in 1.4E7 beta-cells via the MIF pathway."

1057,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Cell culture
1058,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"A hybrid beta-cell line (1.4E7) formed by electrofusion of human pancreatic islets cells with PANC-1 cells, purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK) was used in the experiments. The 1.4E7 cells were grown in 25 cm3 Corning plastic plates in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) (Sigma-Aldrich Co, St. Louis, MO, USA) 1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin until they reached 80% confluence. The cells were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C, and were routinely passaged by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA) prior to detachment with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and splitting at a 1:3 ratio. All ingredients for the media were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (Deisenhofen, Germany). Exposures to the different nanomaterials were done on subconfluent cells."
1059,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Functionalization of carbon nanotubes
1060,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (>98% carbon basis, optical density [OD] × internal diameter [ID] × L 10–15 nm × 2–6 nm × 0.1–10.0 μm; product number 677248) and NA (N0636) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co for the experiments involving covalent functionalization of CNTs. A nonconjugated highly purified MWCNT control solution was prepared as previously described. The product obtained was diluted in physiologic saline solution (NaCl 0.9%) at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v). A 1 M solution of NA was prepared by dissolving 0.122 g of NA per mL of sterile water, providing a 100 × stock solution. In our experiments, the NA was used at a final concentration of 10 mM."
1061,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"Functionalization of MWCNTs with NA was performed as previously described. Briefly, in the first step, MWCNTs were carboxylated by oxidation in a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid (3:1), and the NA molecules were further attached by formation of amide bonds with carboxylic groups using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl) carbodiimidehydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide, which generated MWCNT complexes functionalized with nicotinamide (NA-MWCNTs)."
1062,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Characterization of MWCNTs
1063,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"The ultrastructural morphology of the MWCNTs was evaluated using a transmission electron microscope (JEM 1010, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described. The images were captured using a Mega View III camera (Soft Imaging System, Olympus, Münster, Germany). Spectroscopy was performed using an ultraviolet-visible spectrometer (Mini 1240, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)."
1064,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Exposure conditions
1065,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"For the experiments, the cells were seeded at a density of 2–4 × 104 cells/cm2 on Nunc® Lab-Tek 4 (Sigma-Aldrich) chamber glass slides (No 177399) or in a six-well plate in complete medium and allowed to attach overnight. After 24 hours of cell attachment, the cells were washed with 0.2 mL per cm2 of PBS. The cells were then exposed to suspensions (10 μL) of the test materials (MWCNTs and MWCNTs-NA, NA), or PBS between 1 μg/mL and 20 μg/mL for 30 minutes, one hour, or 3 hours. All experiments were performed in triplicate for each concentration."
1066,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Microscopy analysis of cells
1067,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"For the microscopy analysis, we used Lab-Tek chamber slides for in situ observation of the cells adherent to the glass (the walls were removed and the culture medium was discharged). Thus, no cell transfer was needed prior to visualization/staining. After being exposed to different formulations of MWCNTs/NA, the cells were thoroughly washed three times with 1 × PBS, and then fixed with 10% formaldehyde solution for 10 minutes, washed three times with PBS, and immunochemically stained. Cells in culture were explored using an inverted microscope with phase contrast (FSX10, Olympus, Munich, Germany)."
1068,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Fluorescence immunocytochemistry
1069,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"A standard immunocytochemistry protocol was used. The 1.4E7 cells were treated with 1, 5, or 20 μg/mL MWCNTs, NA-MWCNTs, NA, or PBS alone for 30 minutes, one hour, and 3 hours, respectively, and were then fixed with 3%–4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 minutes at room temperature and ice-cold acetone for 7 minutes, respectively, and subsequently permeabilized with digitonin 0.2% in PBS for 10 minutes. Nonspecific binding of the antibodies was blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.3 M glycine. After 30 minutes of incubation, the cells were further incubated with a guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (ab7842, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted to 1:50 in PBS or with a rabbit polyclonal anti-MIF antibody (No 36–7401, Invitrogen) at 4°C for one hour. Next, the cells were washed and then reacted with a goat polyclonal secondary antibody to guinea pig antibody –H&L (TR) (ab6906, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) diluted to 1:100 in PBS or with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody diluted to 1:1000 at room temperature in the dark for one hour for detection. After being washed with PBS three times for 5 minutes in the dark, the cells were further incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for one minute."
1070,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Image analysis
1071,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"All image analyses were performed using ImageJ version 1.43u (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Quantification of insulin and MIF levels was achieved by applying a linear stretch of the pixel intensity histogram corresponding to each slice in the z-stack in order to increase the image contrast by adjusting the number of low and high intensity pixels. The image was then converted into a z-projection. To remove the spaces between each slice of the z-stack and to create a single image from all slices, the image was further converted into a z-projection. A 7 × 7 top-hat filter was further used followed by a median filter and a threshold step. The thresholded image was then converted to a binary image, which resulted in white structures (insulin/MIF) on a black background that can be analyzed in ImageJ."
1072,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,ELISA quantification of insulin production
1073,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"Quantification of insulin levels in the cell media following treatment was performed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for insulin (E90448Hu, USCN Life Science Inc, Houston, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Insulin concentrations in culture supernatant following treatment were measured using a solid phase sandwich ELISA based on two monoclonal antibodies targeting against insulin epitopes. Briefly, after appropriate insulin secretion stimulation, insulin standards and appropriately diluted (1:50) samples were added to an insulin antibody-precoated multiwell microplate. Next, the secondary antibody was supplemented to the well and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. After a repetitive washing step, addition of tetramethylbenzidine chromogen with short incubation (15 minutes in the dark at room temperature) was performed. The reaction was stopped by addition of H2SO3 reagent. Absorbance at 450 nm was read using a MR-9602G microplate reader and concentrations were calculated using the microplate reader (MG-9620G ELISA) software provided by the manufacturer."
1074,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Glucose stimulation test
1075,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,Following treatment as described the 1.4E7 cells were washed twice with PBS and immersed in 15 mM glucose-containing Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium for 2 hours. The medium was then collected and stored at −20°C for ELISA. The secreted insulin in the 15 mM glucose medium was measured according to the ELISA protocol.
1076,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Flow cytometric analysis
1077,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"A FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA) was used to quantify the number of insulin-producing cells following treatment. Suspensions of treated 1.4E7 cells (NA-MWCNTs/NA/MWCNTs/PBS, respectively) were analyzed by flow cytometry using a red fluorescence (FL3 channel > 670 nm) which was employed to show the population of insulin-producing cells marked with Texas Red® anti-insulin antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The primary and secondary antibodies used were guinea pig anti-insulin antibody (ab7842; Abcam) and goat polyclonal secondary antibody to guinea pig antibody–H&L (TR) (ab6906, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). The resulting comparative cytogram was further used to determine the number of insulin-producing cells per mL. All of the parameters were gathered at low speed in logarithmic mode (approximately 15 μL per minute) in order to maintain the counting level under 1,000 events per second. The threshold value for the FSC (forward scatter channel) channel was 52. The population concentration was estimated using CellQuest software programs (quadrant statistics module)."
1078,PMC3770514,METHODS,title_2,Statistical analysis
1079,PMC3770514,METHODS,paragraph,"All data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Continuous data were tested for normality (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) before hypothesis testing. Fisher’s exact test was used for qualitative data correlations. For all tests, a 0.05 threshold was selected for statistical significance. Statistical data analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 17.0 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA)."
1080,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_1,Results
1081,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,The main goal of this investigation was to develop and test a new method of insulin production enhancement in 1.4E7 beta-cells (Figure 1A). Preliminary data from the literature support the involvement of MIF in enhancement of insulin secretion. This implication is supported by the fact that MIF is a secretory product of the insulin-producing cell that functions as an autocrine regulator of insulin release.
1082,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_2,Characterization of MWCNTs
1083,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,"The diameter and length of the MWCNTs used in the experiments were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Figure 1B). Oxidation of nanotubes was performed using 3:1 (v/v) sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid, which gave them hydrophilicity and stability in aqueous systems due to the formation of COOH and OH groups at the end of or on the lateral sides of the tubes. Next, we covalently conjugated NA onto the surfaces of oxidized MWCNTs. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is a simple but effective method confirming the formation of oxidized NA-MWCNT complexes. Nanotube solutions give an 295.7 nm absorption band, corresponding to transition plasmon MWCNTs (red spectrum). NA solution is characteristic of the 260 nm absorption band, suggesting infrared aromatic structures. Comparing the above-mentioned range, the formation of NA-MWCNT complexes becomes obvious due to the band specific for MWCNTs and the 260 nm band which has a low intensity (blue spectrum) (Figure 1C)."
1084,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_2,Immunofluorescence microscopy
1085,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,"As seen in Figure 2 (row 4) red fluorescence (Texas Red anti-insulin antibody) in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs (5 mg/L for 30 minutes) showed bright, elongated, and punctate fluorescence, evenly spread in the cell cytoplasm, strongly suggesting increased insulin production compared with exposure to 5 mg/L MWCNTs/NA/PBS for 30 minutes. These cells showed a decreased fluorescent signal with less insulin vesicles being visualized. In almost all NA-MWCNT-treated cells, we noticed specific movement of insulin vesicles to the cellular membrane, which resulted in strong diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence. ImageJ quantification of all fluorescent images following treatment of 1.4E7 cells with NA-MWCNTs revealed significantly increased red fluorescence, suggesting insulin production (Chi square test, P < 0.05). Thus, the average area of red fluorescence/total number of cells between cells treated was 3.4 versus 7.2 for 1 mg/L, 5.9 versus 13.1 for 5 mg/L, and 6.9 versus 17.4 for 20 mg/L."
1086,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_2,Flow cytometric quantification of insulin-producing cells
1087,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,"Flow cytometry showed that cultures treated with NA-MWCNTs (5 mg/L) had an increase of 87.3% in insulinpositive cells following incubation (Figure 3Aii), whereas treatment with 5 mg/L NA in similar conditions (Figure 3Ai) resulted in an increase of only 56.3% in insulin-positive cells. Thus, quantification of flow cytometric data from all cells (red FL3 channel) revealed a significantly decreased fluorescence signal (Chi square test, P < 0.05), suggesting a lower proliferation rate in 1.4E7 cells treated with NA only compared with those treated with NA-MWCNTs."
1088,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_2,ELISA quantification of insulin secretion from beta-cell population
1089,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,"Using ELISA to quantify the amount of insulin released in cell culture medium under glucose stimulation following treatment with NA-MWCNTs/NA/MWCNTs/PBS administered at various concentrations and various incubation times, it was found that 1.4E7 cultures treated with NA-MWCNTs secreted more insulin into the supernatant as compared with cultures exposed to NA. As seen in Figure 3B, 1.4E7 cells treated for 30 minutes with NA-MWCNTs at concentrations ranging from 1 mg/L to 20 mg/L showed significantly increased insulin release (0.18 ± 0.026 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.21 ± 0.024 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.27 ± 0.028 ng/mL for 20 mg/L). Thus, compared with cells treated with NA alone (0.1 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 1 mg/L, 0.12 ± 0.017 ng/mL for 5 mg/L, and 0.17 ± 0.01 ng/mL for 20 mg/L, Figure 3C) we observed a significant positive effect on insulin release in cells treated with NA-MWCNTs (Mann–Whitney U test, P = 0.046 for 1 mg/L, P = 0.037 for 5 mg/L, and P = 0.028 for 20 mg/L)."
1090,PMC3770514,RESULTS,title_2,Immunocytochemical localization of MIF in 1.4E7 beta-cells
1091,PMC3770514,RESULTS,paragraph,"To shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in the enhancement of insulin production mediated by MWCNTs, 1.4E7 cells were immunostained with anti-MIF and anti-insulin antibodies (Figure 4). To accomplish this, we allowed cells treated with 5 mg/L NA-MWCNTs for one hour to incorporate Alexa Fluor 488 anti-MIF antibody for 60 minutes at 37°C. This technique allowed us to identify MIF clearly within the cytoplasm of 1.4E7 cells (green fluorescence, Figure 4, third column) that were also positive for insulin (Figure 4, second column). Alternatively, as seen in Figure 4, we showed that anti-insulin antibodies labeled with Texas Red were predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm of these cells overlapping MIF. Of utmost importance, we could clearly observe that MIF was overexpressed in NA-MWCNT-treated cells, strongly suggesting a correlation between NA-MWCNT administration and MIF expression. ImageJ analysis of all fluorescent images revealed significantly increased expression of MIF in 1.4E7 cells (Chi square test, P < 0.05) following treatment with NA-MWCNTs."
1092,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
1093,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Carbon nanotubes show many unique intrinsic physical, mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties, and have been intensively explored for biological and biomedical applications in the past few years."
1094,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Because the physical properties of CNTs are essentially preserved by the noncovalent approach, aqueous solutions of CNTs engineered by noncovalent functionalization are promising for multiple biomedical applications."
1095,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"High doses of NA have protective effects on beta-cell survival and function in animal and in vitro studies, and NA has been shown to increase the insulin content in insulin-producing cells. Moreover, several protocols have used NA as a differentiation factor. NA is also suggested to have a stimulatory effect on islet regeneration. Several studies have confirmed that NA promotes replication of mouse islet cells both in culture and after transplantation. Further, Otonkoski et al showed that the addition of NA to the culture medium of human fetal pancreatic cells increased both the total cell number and the frequency of beta cells. Other authors used a protocol in which insulin-secreting cells (clone IB/3x-99) were cultured in 10 mmol/L NA for 2 weeks followed by another week in 10 mmol/L NA plus 5 mmol/L glucose. They noted that the insulin content of the cells increased 20-fold and that the cells showed a good insulin response to different secretagogues."
1096,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Vaca et al demonstrated that the combination of nutrient restriction and NA supplementation decreases the rate of proliferation and substantially increases the insulin content (1.780 ng insulin/mg protein) in D3 mouse embryonic stem cell culture, a value 3-fold greater than the values obtained by other authors, suggesting that NA may increase insulin synthesis. Therefore, NA plus nutrient restriction increases insulin content and improves the last steps in the maturation process under experimental conditions in which undesired proliferation is controlled."
1097,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"It has been shown previously that the MIF content of pancreatic islets was increased by high glucose concentrations, while immunoneutralization of MIF in a perifusion system of Langerhans islets reduced the first and second phases of glucose-induced insulin secretion by 39% and 31%, respectively. Conversely, exogenously added recombinant MIF was found to potentiate glucose-induced insulin release. Therefore, MIF appears to be a glucose-dependent islet cell product that regulates insulin secretion in a positive manner. Evidence supporting the role of MIF in upregulating insulin secretion comes also from another experiment demonstrating that administration of recombinant MIF in vitro upregulates PDX-1 and insulin gene transcription in mouse islets. Another glucose-induced insulin secretion test performed in vitro showed that pancreatic islets isolated from MIF knockout mice produced less insulin than wild-type C57BL/6 islets but had a higher insulin content within beta-cells. Further, it appears that MIF regulates insulin secretion in physiologic conditions, whereas in pathologic states it alters beta-cell function and induces their apoptosis or necrosis and affects beta-cell neoplasia. Likewise, recent epidemiologic data support the role of MIF in the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in humans. While much progress has been made in the treatment of diabetes mellitus as well as in the study of beta-cell lines, a proper procedure to generate a sufficient mass of insulin-producing cells that display regulated release has not been found as yet. Considering the many potent actions of NA on pancreatic islet cells in animal models and its use in clinical trials to preserve beta-cell function, as well as the exciting properties of CNTs as drug carriers and delivery vehicles, we have characterized the effects of NA-MWCNTs on the function and insulin production of 1.4E7 insulin-secreting cells. Insulinoma cell lines, which display several undifferentiated characteristics even though retaining some of the features of normal islets (for example, peptide hormone biosynthesis and secretion), have applications in the study of pancreatic biology, providing a method of producing pure insulin-secreting cell lines. This is an alternative to the use of primary tissue in cell transplantation therapies for type 1 diabetes. Hence, the 1.4E7 line offers clues on how to generate corresponding human beta-cell lines that may be useful for research and for cell replacement therapy in diabetes. As far as we know, we have noted for the first time that 1.4E7 cells treated with NA-MWCNTs show increased insulin production and regulated insulin secretion as compared with administration of NA or MWCNTs alone."
1098,PMC3770514,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Our immunocytochemistry staining data suggest a strong interaction between NA-MWCNTs and the MIF signaling pathway that regulates insulin secretion, thereby suggesting strategies for developing continuously growing human beta-cell lines. Nevertheless, further investigations are required for a careful assessment of unexpected toxicities and biological interactions of NA-MWCNTs inside the living organism."

1126,PMC3940070,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Background
1127,PMC3940070,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) mutations in presenilin (PS) modulate PS/γ-secretase activity and therefore contribute to AD pathogenesis. Previously, we found that PS/γ-secretase cleaves voltage-gated sodium channel β2 subunits (Navβ2), releases the intracellular domain of Navβ2 (β2-ICD), and thereby increases intracellular sodium channel α-subunit Nav1.1 levels. Here, we tested whether FAD-linked PS1 mutations modulate Navβ2 cleavages and Nav1.1 levels."

1129,PMC3940070,ABSTRACT,abstract,To analyze the effects of PS1-linked FAD mutations on Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 levels in neuronal cells.

Navβ2 processing and Nav1.1 protein and mRNA levels were then analyzed by Western blot and real-time RT-PCR, respectively."

Nav1.1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the surface levels of Nav channel α-subunits, were also significantly reduced in PS1 (E280A) cells."
1134,PMC3940070,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Conclusion
1135,PMC3940070,ABSTRACT,abstract,Our data indicate that the FAD-linked PS1 E280A mutation decreases Nav channel levels by partially inhibiting PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Navβ2 in neuronal cells.
1136,PMC3940070,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1137,PMC3940070,INTRO,paragraph,"Mutations in the presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1) are the most common genetic cause of Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). PS1 mutations are likely to exert their pathophysiological effect by altering PS1/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), resulting in increased Aβ42/40 ratios. PSEN1 FAD patients are affected by early onset cognitive decline typical of AD, but additional symptoms are also present in patients with select FAD mutations. These include myoclonus and/or seizures, apraxia, dystonia, and behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. However, molecular mechanisms underlying these atypical symptoms are not fully understood."
1138,PMC3940070,INTRO,paragraph,"Previously, we and others reported that the β2-subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Navβ2) is a substrate of BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase. We found that PS/γ-secretase–mediated cleavages of Navβ2 C-terminal fragments (β2-CTFs) released the intracellular domains of Navβ2 (β2-ICDs), which was localized to the nucleus and increased mRNA and protein levels of a Nav channel α-subunit, Nav1.1. These studies clearly demonstrate that PS/γ-secretase-mediated processing of Navβ2 plays a major role in regulating neuronal sodium channel Nav1.1. Since Nav1 channels play an important role in neural activity, here we tested if specific PS1 FAD mutations contribute to abnormal Nav1.1 levels by altering Navβ2 processing."

1150,PMC3940070,RESULTS,title_1,Results and Discussion
1151,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"To study the effects of PS1 mutations on Nav1 channels, we stably cotransfected B104 rat neuroblastoma cells with Navβ2 and wtPS1 or PS1(E280A or M146L), both FAD mutations associated with clinical seizures or PS1(ΔE9), a FAD mutation with no reported seizures, or PS2(D333G), a non FAD-linked mutation. B104 cells express endogenous Nav1 channel components and have previously been used for studying Nav1.1 channel regulation by BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase. In these cells, we first analyzed levels of β2-CTF, a direct substrate for PS/γ-secretase (supplemental Fig. 1a). Interestingly, we found that a seizure-related FAD-linked PS1 mutation, E280A increased β2-CTF levels by 3.7 fold as compared to the control cells (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 1b). We also observed a moderate increase of β2-CTF levels (1.9 fold) in PS1(M146L) cells but this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1a and supplemental Fig. 1b). Ectodomain shedding by ADAM10 or BACE1 was not increased, since we were unable to detect elevated β2-CTF levels in the same cells pretreated with the PS/γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (Fig. 1a). This indicates that the E280A mutation prevents PS/γ-secretase cleavage of Navβ2."
1152,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"To confirm this, we quantitated levels of the PS/γ-secretase cleavage product β2-ICD (Fig. 1b and c). Since β2-ICDs are quickly degraded within the cytoplasm, a cell-free γ-secretase cleavage assay system (Fig. 1b) or overexpression of recombinant myc-tagged β2-CTF substrate (Fig. 1c) are required to detect β2-ICDs. Both assays showed a dramatic decrease in β2-ICDs with PS1(E280A) expression (Fig. 1b, c). Steady state levels of myc-β2-CTF were largely elevated in PS1 (E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 controls (supplemental Fig. 2b and c). Together, these data demonstrate that the PS1 E280A mutation decreases PS/γ-secretase–mediated Navβ2 cleavages in neuronal cells."
1153,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we tested whether the PS1 E280A mutation reduces Nav1.1 levels by decreasing β2-ICD levels. By using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we analyzed Nav1.1 mRNA levels of PS1(E280A) and wtPS1 cell clones ((n= 4 for PS1(E280A) and 3 for wtPS1)). We found that Nav1.1 mRNA levels are dramatically decreased in PS1(E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 cells, which is consistent with decreased β2-ICD levels in these cells (Fig. 2a). As expected, we also found that Nav1.1 protein levels were significantly decreased in PS1(E280A) cells (Fig. 2b). These data strongly indicate that the PS1 E280A mutation decreased Nav1.1 levels by reducing β2-ICD generation in these cells."
1154,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"To test whether the decrease in Nav1.1 levels led to a reduction in functional Nav1 channels, we analyzed cell surface levels of Nav1 α-subunits (Fig. 2c and d). We have previously shown that decreases in surface Nav1 α-subunit levels were directly responsible for decreased sodium currents in the same cells. By using a cell surface biotinylation assay, we found that surface Nav1 α-subunit levels were dramatically decreased in PS1(E280A) cells as compared to wtPS1 controls (Fig. 2c and d). Pharmacological inhibition of PS/γ-secretase activity confirmed our data with PS1(E280A) overexpression, as DAPT robustly reduced surface Nav1 α-subunit levels in B104 cells expressing Navβ2 without PS1(E280A) expression (Supplemental Fig. 3). Together, our results indicate that PS1 E280A mutation decreased PS/γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of Navβ2, β2-ICD generation, Nav1.1 α-subunit precursor levels, and therefore reduced the surface Nav1 channels and possibly sodium currents and membrane excitability (Fig. 3)."
1155,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"Recently, we reported that BACE1 ablation decreased Nav1.1 mRNA and proteins levels in mouse brains due to reduced endogenous β2-ICD levels. Consistent with our findings, Hu et al. also showed that Nav1.1 and Nav1.2/6 levels were significantly decreased in BACE1-null mice, although the changes in Nav1.2/6 were not observed in other reports. A recent study in the PS/APP AD mouse model also showed that the elevated BACE1 levels in these mice led to the accumulation of endogenous β2-ICD in nuclei of cortical neurons, increased, Nav1.1 levels, and possibly contributed to aberrant neuronal activity and cognitive deficits. Together, these data strongly support a physiological role of β2-ICD in regulating Nav1.1 levels in brains."
1156,PMC3940070,RESULTS,paragraph,"AD patients with PS1 E280A mutation display frequent epileptic seizures at the early ages and a study showed that the early onset seizures in PS1 E280A patients strongly associated with CA1 hippocampal neuronal loss. Recent studies in AD mouse models also provide strong evidence that altered Nav1.1 channel levels are responsible for seizures, abnormal neural activities and even a cognitive decline in these mice. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel molecular pathway that can contribute to AD pathology in patients with PS1 E280A mutation. Further studies will be required to fully elucidate whether PS1(E280A) and possibly other epilepsy-associated PS FAD mutations contribute to AD pathology by modulating Nav1.1 channels in vivo."

1179,PMC4626022,TITLE,front,Proteomic Analysis of the Relationship between Metabolism and Nonhost Resistance in Soybean Exposed to Bipolaris maydis
1180,PMC4626022,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Nonhost resistance (NHR) pertains to the most common form of plant resistance against pathogenic microorganisms of other species. Bipolaris maydis is a non-adapted pathogen affecting soybeans, particularly of maize/soybean intercropping systems. However, no experimental evidence has described the immune response of soybeans against B. maydis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying NHR in soybeans, proteomics analysis based on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed to identify proteins involved in the soybean response to B. maydis. The spread of B. maydis spores across soybean leaves induced NHR throughout the plant, which mobilized almost all organelles and various metabolic processes in response to B. maydis. Some enzymes, including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO), mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP), oxygen evolving enhancer (OEE), and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDKs), were found to be related to NHR in soybeans. These enzymes have been identified in previous studies, and STRING analysis showed that most of the protein functions related to major metabolic processes were induced as a response to B. maydis, which suggested an array of complex interactions between soybeans and B. maydis. These findings suggest a systematic NHR against non-adapted pathogens in soybeans. This response was characterized by an overlap between metabolic processes and response to stimulus. Several metabolic processes provide the soybean with innate immunity to the non-adapted pathogen, B. maydis. This research investigation on NHR in soybeans may foster a better understanding of plant innate immunity, as well as the interactions between plant and non-adapted pathogens in intercropping systems."
1181,PMC4626022,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1182,PMC4626022,INTRO,paragraph,"Nonhost resistance (NHR) is a plant immune response against major microorganisms that are pathogenic to other plant species. Unlike R-gene-mediated resistance, which is governed by either a single or a few genes, NHR is mainly controlled by multiple genes expressed in multiple patterns and durable defense responses. Due to its highly robust and exceptional resistance properties, NHR is of scientific and economic importance. Information regarding the mechanism underlying NHR may serve as a foundation for the development of novel strategies for crop disease management and crop distribution."
1183,PMC4626022,INTRO,paragraph,"Soybeans are an important crop throughout the world because of their high plant protein and oil content. Growing a combination of different crops and species in one field can boost yield and suppress crop diseases. Maize/soybean intercropping is a common combination used in some countries to address issues of limited arable land and increasing food demand. In the maize/soybean intercropping system, maize is susceptible to infection by Bipolaris maydis, whereas soybeans present no detectable symptoms of disease. B. maydis does not have a soybean pathogen phenotype, nor is it related to any known soybean pathogens. In addition, it does not infect soybeans via touch interactions. A previous microscopy analysis of infected soybeans showed that successful callose deposition and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production (S1 Fig) may be the first line of defense against B. maydis growth. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that soybean resistance to B. maydis is established via NHR, which is the most robust and durable forms of plant resistance in nature. It allows soybean plants to protect themselves against a wide variety of parasitic microorganisms."
1184,PMC4626022,INTRO,paragraph,"In the past few decades, several studies have confirmed the existence of NHR in plants. Unlike the well-studied host resistance conferred by plant resistance (R) genes, the molecular basis of NHR remains elusive. In this present study, the foundation of soybean NHR against B. maydis, a pathogen affecting a remotely related plant species, was characterized at the proteomic level. The availability of complete soybean genome sequences and recent developments in various sequencing technologies have allowed us to investigate the complex mechanisms underlying NHR in soybeans at the protein level."
1185,PMC4626022,INTRO,paragraph,"Plants respond to stresses via differential expression of sets of genes, which results in changes in protein levels. The proteome represents the global protein expression profile of a species at a given time and under a set of conditions. Proteomic analysis involves identifying proteins involved in stress responses, determining their functions, and identifying possible regulatory networks that can be used to interpret stress-responsive processes that occur in plants."
1186,PMC4626022,INTRO,paragraph,"In a previous study, although there were no visible symptoms in soybean leaves inoculated with B. maydis, microscopic observations showed that successful callose deposition and H2O2 production (S1 Fig) may be the immediate response of a plant to restrict the growth of B. maydis. Information on the molecular mechanism underlying this kind of robust and durable defense in whole soybean plants is currently limited. To better understand the mechanism of NHR in soybean, it is important to identify proteins that might be involved in the soybean response to exposure to B. maydis, determine the types of metabolic proteins involved in the NHR in soybeans, compare the findings of the present study and those of previous NHR investigations in plants, and determine whether any organelle was involved in the response to B. maydis. This present study addresses these issues and summarizes the metabolic processes involved in NHR in soybeans. The results may facilitate further our understanding of NHR in soybean plants."

1189,PMC4626022,METHODS,paragraph,"Seeds of the soybean cultivar Hua Chun 6 were sown in floriculture substrate in pots [15 cm (D) × 15 cm (H)] and grown in a greenhouse (70% relative humidity, 25°C/20°C day/night temperature, 14 h/10 h photoperiod) at a density of two plants per pot. These pots contained a mixture of sand and floriculture substrate at a ratio of 1:1. Samples of B. maydis race O (Y664) were collected from Wenshan Prefecture (east longitude 104°35′ and northern latitude 23°18′) in China’s Yunnan Province and preserved at the Yunnan Agricultural University College of Plant Protection. The B. maydis isolate was grown for 8 days at 27°C in a culture medium containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) and in the dark. The PDA medium was prepared as described elsewhere. Conidia were collected with sterilized water (with 0.1% Tween-20) and the concentration was adjusted to 1 × 105 conidia per mL. This mixture served as the inoculating solution. Then, 200 mL of sterilized water (with 0.1% Tween-20) was used for mock inoculation of the controls, and 200 mL of the conidia solution was used to inoculate the treatment groups. At 72 h post-inoculation, soybean leaves, stems, and roots were collected from both B. maydis-inoculated and mock-inoculated (control) soybean seedlings, and the stems and roots were cut into 1-cm sections for easier grounding. Three replicates were prepared for each experiment."

After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, and the protein pellet was washed three times with 2 mM PMSF and 50 mM DTT in 80% acetone. The pellet was dried with a circulating water vacuum pump (SHZ-IIID, Shanghai, China). A 20-mg fraction of the protein powder was then resuspended in 450 μL of lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 5% (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 2 mM DTT, and 0.3% Biolyte) by flicking the tube wall with fingers, and then incubated for 1 h at 25°C (or room temperature). The suspension was later centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 20 min at 25°C, and then the resulting supernatant was collected. The protein content of the samples was quantitated using the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as protein standard.

The adjusted protein solution was vortexed and centrifuged for 5 min at 22,000 rpm at 4°C and then was directly loaded into a focusing tray. IPG strips (4–7 NL, 24 cm; GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany) were passively rehydrated for 14 h at 20°C. Then, the proteins (three replicates per treatment) were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and then in the second dimension via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)."

1200,PMC4626022,METHODS,paragraph,The minimum requirements of our protein analysis were as follows: (i) at least three peptide sequences with identities higher than the threshold matched; and (ii)≧9% coverage of the total protein sequence by matching peptide-positive matches were BLASTP searched against the NCBI protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) for updated annotation and identification of homologous proteins. Some of the predicted cellular locations were determined using the Plant-PLoc version 2.0 (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/).

This was followed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel and Coomassie staining. 2-DE maps of proteins from untreated control leaves or leaves treated with B. maydis are shown. Proteins differentially regulated in response to B. maydis were numbered in pairs of control and treatment maps. The MW (kDa) and pI of each protein was determined using a 2-DE marker."
1207,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 18 protein spots showed significant changes (|ratio| > 2, P < 0.05). Among these, 16 proteins were further classified by using MALDI-TOF-MS as provided by AmiGO into five groups, including proteins related to metabolic processes, catalytic activity, developmental processes, cellular components (such as structural proteins), and defense response (Fig 1, Table 1). Eight of the nine metabolic proteins were located in chloroplasts. Of these, 6 proteins showed increased staining intensity and 2 proteins showed decreased staining intensity."
1208,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (here considered indicative of catalytic activity) was located in the nucleus, and its concentration increased by 9.2-fold. The spot representing the stress-response protein oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 increased in staining intensity. The spots representing 2 defense proteins, including acidic chitinase and trypsin inhibitor, also increased in staining intensity, mainly in the vacuole. The intensity of spot 74, which represented the V-type proton ATPase subunit B 1-like isoform 2, showed a decrease in staining intensity in the cytoplasm, whereas that of its subunit, B 2-like isoform 2, increased (Table 1). Some of these differentially expressed proteins are involved in metabolic processes, developmental processes, organization of cellular components, and catalytic activity. Expression of these particular proteins in soybean leaves was induced in response to B. maydis, together with the production of acidic chitinase and trypsin inhibitor."
1209,PMC4626022,RESULTS,title_2,Twenty-five proteins were expressed in the stems of soybean plants in response to B. maydis
1210,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Several studies have documented that leaf and root proteomics can be used to interpret the responses of soybeans to biotic and abiotic stress. However, the stem protein response to pathogens is remains elusive. Here, 72 hpi stem proteomic analysis was performed to produce a more systemic understanding of how the three major organs (roots, stems, and leaves) of soybean plants are involved in the responses to the non-adapted pathogen B. maydis. Approximately 1,000 ± 50 protein spots were separated on 2-DE gels (Fig 2)."

1213,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Among these 26, 25 differentially expressed (|ratio| > 2, P < 0.05) proteins were successfully identified and sorted into five functional groups, including proteins associated with metabolic processes, cellular components, defense response, developmental processes, and molecular function (Table 2). Here, 48% of the stem proteins were determined to be involved in metabolic processes. The spots associated with half of these showed an increase in staining intensity with B. maydis infection, whereas half showed a decrease. Around 16% of the evaluated stem mitochondrial proteins showed a change in expression after infection, suggesting that NHR in soybeans is involved in significant energy consumption. Two of the mitochondrial proteins were related to heat shock 70, which is the protein chaperone that is responsible for the refolding and misfolding of proteins. A putative cysteine protease was grouped into the metabolic process group, although a previous study reported that it is involved in both developmental and pathogen-related PCD. Protein spots 4, 8, and 19 had functional annotations similar to those of Hsp70, although these were classified in different functional groups and were predicted to localize to different locations (mitochondrion and chloroplast), which was consistent with the diverse locations and functions of Hsps. The staining intensity of spot 19 (Hsp 70) showed a 12-fold increase relative to that of the controls."
1214,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"This phenomenon indicates that NHR in soybean is related to protein functional diversity. Protein spot 10 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase), protein spot 17 (26S protease regulatory subunit 6B homolog), and protein spot 25 (peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP20-2, chloroplastic-like isoform 2) were predicted to have more than one subcellular location. Protein spot 7 (oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1, chloroplastic-like) was found to have been caused by the same protein as leaf protein spot 34, which showed a 2.5-fold increase in expression in leaves and a 11-fold increase expression in stems. This finding suggests that protein spot 34 might play an important role in soybean response to B. maydis. The staining intensity of protein spot 14 increased by 10-fold and that of protein spot 24 decreased by 6-fold in the nuclei of soybean stems. All 25 stem proteins were predicted in various important subcellular locations, including the nucleus, cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vacuole, chloroplast, and mitochondrion, which indicated that the response proteins might include proteins related to metabolism."

S1/ES1 and S15/ES15 are representative differentially expressed root proteins."
1219,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Almost 1,000 proteins were detected in the CSS gel using PDQuest software 7.4, and all replicate gels showed highly similar distribution patterns in the 2-DE images. Around 25 proteins were differentially expressed (|ratio|≥2, P < 0.05). Overall analysis revealed that out of all the protein spots that matched in the treatment and control groups, 39% showed increased intensity and 61% presented a decrease in intensity. Twenty-three of these differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified in six functional groups, including proteins related to metabolic processes, cellular components, regulation of cellular processes, transmembrane transport, defense response, and molecular function (Table 3). These proteins were detected in the nucleus, cytoplasm, cell wall, cell membrane, mitochondrion, and Golgi apparatus of root cells in response to a B. maydis challenge on leaves, which might contribute to the multiple NHR responses to non-adapted pathogens."
1220,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Protein spots 1 and 19 were identified as elongation factor 1-delta-like (2.7-fold increase) and elongation factor 1-gamma-like (16.7-fold increase) proteins, which were predicted to localize to the mitochondrion and cytoplasm, respectively. This indicated that the metabolic processes related to protein synthesis in soybean roots might be different in response to B. maydis."
1221,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"Protein spot 25, which is a copper amino oxidase precursor, showed a significant increase in intensity (33.1-fold) in soybean root organs. Chalcone isomerase 4-like, proteasome subunit beta type-6-like, and alcohol dehydrogenase 1-like proteins are related to flavone and alcohol metabolic processes, showed an increase in spot intensity in response to B. maydis, which indicated that several proteins in the roots might be bifunctional under stress conditions."
1222,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"The spot intensities of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like and auxin-induced protein decreased, suggesting that the soybean root cells underwent a reduction in growth to increase its defense response to the infection. On the other hand, the intensity of protein spot 8, which is related to a protease, increased. This finding indicated that the protein degradation process also increased in response to B. maydis (Table 3)."
1223,PMC4626022,RESULTS,paragraph,"In summary, almost all of the plant cell organelles were predicted to respond to the B. maydis challenge on leaves, and the biological processes involved in growth and development were possibly bifunctional."
1224,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
1225,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Competitive and facilitative interactions among different plant species have played major roles in shaping natural communities. For decades, this principle has been employed to increase crop yield. Plants sense their environments using chemicals, touch, and light. In maize/soybean intercropping systems, the transfer of B. maydis spores from maize to soybeans is a common occurrence. There have been several reports of interactions between maize and soybeans, and these have been extensively used to increase yield or improve soil fertility. However, there has been no report discussing the interactions between soybeans and B. maydis, which often come into contact in ecological networks involving maize and soybean intercropping systems. Therefore, the findings of the present study not only offer new insights into NHR in the soybean response to B. maydis, but also into the positive interactions mediated by B. maydis between soybeans and maize. This is the first detailed study on how B. maydis mediates interactions between maize and soybeans."
1226,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,title_2,Whole-plant resistance is invoked in almost all of cellular components of the soybean plant
1227,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although B. maydis was sprayed only onto the leaves of the soybean plants, proteins of the stem and roots also responded to this particular stimulus (Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4). These results suggest that the response of soybeans to B. maydis may not be limited to the site of exposure, and that the signal of the stimulus could be transmitted to remote organs. The level of expression of several proteins was reprogrammed far from the site of inoculation. Only one pair of root and stem protein spots consisted of the same protein, e.g., S (stem) 15 and R (root) 13, an alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase [UDP-forming] homolog. Two pairs of stem and leaf protein spots (L17 and S24) comprised the same protein, the NDK homolog. Leaf protein spot (L34) and stem protein spot (S7) contained an oxygen-evolving enhancer protein homolog. However, there was no protein overlap between leaves and roots. These results suggest that roots, stems, and leaves of soybeans could differentially respond to B. maydis challenge on leaves, which could render a whole plant resistant to B. maydis. Thus, almost all of the metabolic proteins were triggered in almost all subcellular structures. These included the cell wall, cell membrane, cell skeleton, cytoplasm, chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleus, Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (Fig 4A). This is the first report to find evidence of a multiple-responsive NHR in soybeans against B. maydis, a pathogenic fungus of a phylogenetically distant crop."

An L, S, or R character was placed before the spots (corresponding to the 2-DE pattern) corresponding to leaf, stem, and root proteins. Two pairs of leaf and stem protein spots were attributed to the same protein, L17 and S24, and L34 and S7. There was only one pair of stem and root protein spots that was attributed to the same protein, S15 and R13. However, no protein overlap between leaf and root was detected."
1230,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,title_2,Proteins involved in NHR in soybean overlapped with metabolic proteins
1231,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"NHR is strongly associated to basic plant metabolism, and host pathogens are known to target such primary metabolic pathways to establish virulence. The results of the present study showed that proteins related to metabolic processes could be co-induced in response to non-adapted pathogens. For example, the ability of soybean plants to cope with B. maydis stress depends on a number of changes in their proteins, which the present study has determined to be reprogrammed after inoculation of B. maydis on leaves, and the changes remained in effect until at least 72 hpi. Several metabolic proteins in the leaves, stems, and roots of soybeans were invoked in response to B. maydis. Most of these proteins had essential functions, either in the regulation of the response, or in the metabolic process, allowing plants to survive and recover from the stresses."
1232,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The leaf protein RuBisCO operates as a metabolic branch point, channeling carbon either to the photosynthetic carbon fixation (Calvin–Benson) cycle or to the photorespiratory pathway. It is the most abundant protein in green plant tissues and is a bifunctional enzyme. Its most common form (type I presents in cyanobacteria, green algae, and higher plants) is composed of eight chloroplast-gene-encoded large subunits (~55 kDa) and eight nuclear gene-encoded small subunits (~15 kDa). Two protein spots were identified as RuBisCO large subunits, which suggested that soybean photosynthesis was reprogrammed under B. maydis stress conditions."
1233,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,BAHD acyltransferase catalyzes the acylation of various plant secondary metabolites. The decrease in intensity of BAHD acyltransferase DCR-like (spot 66 in leaf) protein suggests that the metabolites were inhibited under B. maydis stress.
1234,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The intensity of the spot attributable to 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HDR) f-like protein decreased in response to B. maydis, which is also involved in a pivotal secondary metabolite process in NHR in soybeans (spot 77 in Table 1). Plant isoprenoids are involved in several key biological processes, including membrane fluidity, photosynthesis, growth regulation, cell division, communication, and defense response. Gene knockout has demonstrated that HDR activity is not only essential to Escherichia coli growth, but also plays a key role in plant isoprenoid biosynthesis. Decreases in the intensity of leaf HDR and BAHD proteins suggests that B. maydis stress inhibited the metabolic processes of soybeans or some decrease in fitness is needed for the soybeans to resist B. maydis, although no visible symptoms have been detected."
1235,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"There are many families of cysteine proteases in stems. These are also known as thiol proteases. Among these, C1A cysteine protease is the most abundant enzyme and is responsible for protein degradation during plant senescence. Dozens of lattices from different plant families are known to contain cysteine proteases. Several of these plant proteases accumulate in the central vacuole, from which these can be released as programmed cell death stimuli or other stress cues. These vacuole-localized proteases belong to the C1A family of cysteine proteases and are involved in both developmental and pathogen-related PCD. Stem (spot 16) mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP; EC 3.4.24.64) is a heterodimeric enzyme that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial protein import. MPP is integrated into a protein complex of the respiratory chain in plants, and plays an essential role in proteolytical processing. The increase in the intensity of spots attributable to the production of subunits of MPP might be due to the NHR of soybean."
1236,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are molecular chaperones that facilitate proper protein folding and function in almost all organisms. These are classified into families based on their molecular weight: Hsps include Hsps 40, 60, 70, 90, and 100. In this present study, some Hsps were detected in either the chloroplasts or mitochondria. Stress often increases the number of unfolded proteins in the cytosol. The unfolded proteins require more molecular chaperones for re-folding, which makes the stressed cell more dependent upon the Hsps than unstressed cells. In the present study, Hsp 70 was detected in stem protein 19, and it showed the most pronounced increase in spot intensity of any protein in the mitochondria (12-fold), which suggested that stem proteins were involved in the response to B. maydis."
1237,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The eukaryotic translation elongation factor plays an important role in translation elongation. The accumulation of maize chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor has been reported to alleviate heat stress. Elongation factor 1-delta-like protein was identified in root spot 1 (intensity increased by 2.7-fold) and elongation factor 1-gamma-like protein was found in root spot 19 (increased by 16.7-fold). Both were highly expressed in root cells, which suggested that the high level accumulation of elongation factor might be good evidence that new proteins are produced in soybean roots in response to exposure to the non-adapted pathogen B. maydis."
1238,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Protein spot 8 was attributed to root proteins related to increased protease concentration. This suggested that the protein degradation process also increased in response to B. maydis (Table 3), which suggested that protein processing occurred in the root organs of soybeans."
1239,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Some major metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, acylation of plant secondary metabolites, synthesis and degradation of proteins, and protein refolding, were determined to be involved in soybean NHR against B. maydis. Therefore, soybean plants can undergo NHR in response to resistant B. maydis at the expense of metabolism-related proteins."
1240,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Analysis of the interactions among 64 proteins differentially expressed in the roots, stems, and leaves of soybeans in response to B. maydis provided further bioinformatic evidence of the overlap between metabolism and stimulus response. This analysis was performed using STRING (Fig 5). The results suggested that ~80% of proteins were involved in metabolic processes (P = 1.070e -10) and response to stimulus (P = 3.970e -10). For example, LOS2 is a copper ion binding/phosphopyruvate hydratase. It encodes an enolase that is involved in light-dependent cold tolerance. Its protein is tyrosine-phosphorylated and its phosphorylation state is modulated in response to ABA in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (www.string.db.org) (Fig 5). BLAST analysis using the Arabidopsis DB was performed. These proteins belonged to both the response pathway and biological processes. This theoretical overlap of metabolism and defense processes was consistent with the observed overlap between metabolic and defense processes (Fig 4, Tables 1–3)."

1242,PMC4626022,FIG,fig_caption,"GO analysis indicated that the 38 red nodes in A might be involved in metabolic processes (P value = 1.070e −10). Another 35 red nodes in B were involved in stimulus response (P value = 3.970e −10). Thirty proteins belonged to the both metabolic process and response to stimulus, which suggested that the same protein could perform different functions in soybean plants in response to B. maydis stress."
1243,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,title_2,Defense-related proteins in response to B. maydis
1244,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In addition to co-induction of metabolic proteins against B. maydis, NHR in soybeans also activates defense-related proteins in response to B. maydis. Chitinases expressed during plant-pathogen interactions are associated with plant defense against pathogens, which can catalyze polychitin molecules that are present in the cell walls of most fungi and homologues in plant-pathogen interactions. Plants possess a large reservoir of protease inhibitor (PI) genes, which have been proposed to act as storage proteins, regulators of endogenous proteases, and most notably in defense against herbivores. They have potent applications in resistant crop breeding. However, an Ecc licitor-induced Kunitz trypsin inhibitor gene (AtKTI1) encoding a functional Kunitz type PI protein was isolated in Arabidopsis, and demonstrated that the PI protein played a regulatory role in PCD antagonizing pathogen and FB1-induced cell death. In the present study, the expression of the trypsin inhibitor and acidic chitinase increased in the vacuoles of soybean leaf cells, which indicated that these played key roles in NHR of soybeans to B. maydis."
1245,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Malate dehydrogenases (MDHs) often use malate or oxaloacetate as substrates to generate pyruvate and preferentially utilize NADP or NAD as cofactors. These differ in their subcellular localization among and within species. The function and regulation of MDH in animals are specifically associated with cell differentiation and proliferation, ontogenic development, hormonal control, and diseases. Stem protein spots 23 and 24 were identified as malate dehydrogenases (MDHs), which suggested that these might play a role in soybean NHR against B. maydis and provide new insights into their regulatory function beyond their classical role in basic metabolism."
1246,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Isoflavone reductase is an enzyme associated with isoflavonoid biosynthesis in plants, and its overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) causes tolerance to reactive oxygen species, thus indicating that rice isoflavone reductase plays an essential role in maintaining the levels of ROS. Root protein spot 16 was identified as soybean isoflavone reductase-like protein, which might be involved in NHR of soybean to B. maydis."
1247,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Cell-wall-associated kinases (WAKs 1–5) and their isoforms have been shown to functionally mediate differential signals from the extracellular matrix to the cells. Oxygen evolving enhancer protein 1 (OEE1) is a chloroplast protein that acts as an auxiliary component of the photosystem II manganese cluster. A previous study has shown that OEE2 interacts with and acts as a substrate for WAK1, and is phosphorylated via the action of AtGRP-3. Phosphorylation of OEE2 is also induced in Arabidopsis by exposure to the avirulent Pseudomonas syringae. OEE2 is downstream of AtGRP-3/WAK1, and may be involved in defense signaling. OEE1 was upregulated 11-fold in this present study (stem spot 7 and upregulated 2.5-fold in leaf protein spot 34), which suggested that strong defense signaling had been taking place in the soybean cells under the B. maydis stress conditions. In addition, Ning’s results showed that OEE played an important role in photosynthesis and stress resistance for plants. Its subcellular location was predicted in chloroplasts."
1248,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,title_2,Similarity and differences of NHR in soybean and other plants
1249,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The proteomic basis of NHR in the soybean response to B. maydis, a pathogen affecting remotely related species, was assessed. Results showed the soybean NHR response to have many similarities to that of other plants such as callose deposition and H2O2 production. The basic biological processes involved in soybean NHR against B. maydis, including some vital metabolic components for plant growth and development such as RuBisCO, BAHD, and OEE were different from the NHRs of other plants. Soybean NHR involved almost all of the organelle (Fig 4, Table 4); this is the first work to indicate the involvement of NHR in organelles."
1250,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"These results have allowed us to propose a hypothesis relating to soybean NHR, which affected almost all of the organelles in the cells of soybean plants (Fig 4 and Table 4). Soybean NHR against B. maydis is a type I nonhost resistance. Unlike host resistance that is mediated by the products of plant resistance genes (R), which involves pathogen-race- or plant-cultivar-specific interaction, the soybean NHR involved multiple-gene resistance, which involved multiple biological process, cellular components, and molecular functions in response to non-adapted pathogens. This may explain why a pathogen that is virulent to one plant species is nonpathogenic to another. These results could not only be used in intercropping systems involving soybeans but also in rotations involving nonhost plants in an agroecosystem."
1251,PMC4626022,DISCUSS,paragraph,"A preliminary conclusion can be drawn from the results of the present study. Soybeans can respond to B. maydis stimulus and this involves almost all subcellular structures and major metabolic processes and multiple-gene resistance through reprogramming far from the site of inoculation. This response included multiple biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. Some major proteins such as RuBisCO, BAHD, NDK, and OEE were involved in NHR in soybean and overlapped with metabolic proteins. Proteins related to metabolic processes were co-induced in response to non-adapted pathogens, which differs from the results of previous studies of NHR [1–3; 8–10; 12–13]. Similarly, the expression of acidic chitinases, protease, and Kunitz type PI (protease inhibitor) proteins changed in the vacuoles of soybean leaf cells, which indicated that these played major roles in NHR of soybeans to B. maydis. This is the first report to find evidence for a multiple-responsive NHR in soybeans against B. maydis, a pathogenic fungus of a phylogenetically distant crop. These findings may offer insights into the microbe-mediated interactions between plant species, which play a basic role in shaping natural communities and crop yields. However, identification of the associations among the systematic responses and assessment of resistance at multiple levels in soybeans require further investigation."

1265,PMC4707177,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Here, we have compiled a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-derived set of nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) distance and dihedral angle restraints that allow for the calculation of the structure of the NDH-1 complex subunit CupS from Thermosynechococcus elongatus in solution. These restraints to calculate the structure in solution of CupS have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org) under PDB-ID accession number 2MXA. This is the first experimental data set published to compute the three-dimensional structure of CupS. This structure is presented in the research article “Solution structure of the NDH-1 complex subunit CupS from Thermosynechococcus elongatus” published by Korste et al. in Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1847(2015)1212–1219. The cyanobacterial multi-subunit membrane protein complex NDH-1 structurally and functionally relates to Complex I of eubacteria and mitochondria.

1297,PMC5742711,TITLE,front,Potential role of the methylation of VEGF gene promoter in response to hypoxia in oxygen‐induced retinopathy: beneficial effect of the absence of AQP4
1298,PMC5742711,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Abstract
1299,PMC5742711,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Hypoxia‐dependent accumulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in retinal diseases characterized by neovessel formation. In this study, we investigated whether the glial water channel Aquaporin‐4 (AQP4) is involved in the hypoxia‐dependent VEGF upregulation in the retina of a mouse model of oxygen‐induced retinopathy (OIR). The expression levels of VEGF, the hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), the production of nitric oxide (NO), the methylation status of the HIF‐1 binding site (HBS) in the VEGF gene promoter, the binding of HIF‐1α to the HBS, the retinal vascularization and function have been determined in the retina of wild‐type (WT) and AQP4 knock out (KO) mice under hypoxic (OIR) or normoxic conditions. In response to 5 days of hypoxia, WT mice were characterized by (i) AQP4 upregulation, (ii) increased levels of VEGF, HIF‐1α, iNOS and NO, (iii) pathological angiogenesis as determined by engorged retinal tufts and (iv) dysfunctional electroretinogram (ERG). AQP4 deletion prevents VEGF, iNOS and NO upregulation in response to hypoxia thus leading to reduced retinal damage although in the presence of high levels of HIF‐1α. In AQP4 KO mice, HBS demethylation in response to the beginning of hypoxia is lower than in WT mice reducing the binding of HIF‐1α to the VEGF gene promoter. We conclude that in the absence of AQP4, an impaired HBS demethylation prevents HIF‐1 binding to the VEGF gene promoter and the relative VEGF transactivation, reducing the VEGF‐induced retinal damage in response to hypoxia."
1300,PMC5742711,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1301,PMC5742711,INTRO,paragraph,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane water channel proteins allowing water to flow through cell plasma membranes in response to osmotic and hydrostatic gradients 1. Among AQPs, AQP4 is the most abundant in brain and retina 2 and its role in maintaining water homoeostasis in the retina has been extensively studied 3. AQP4 has been localized to the Müller cell end feet, where it facilitates water flux at the glial–vascular interface 3, 4. AQP4 deletion results in a gliotic phenotype 5 although this phenotype does not result in altered retinal responses to light 6. There are several indications that AQP4 is overexpressed in experimental models of retinal diseases 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. In some of these models, AQP4 downregulation is generally associated with an amelioration of the pathological signs of the disease 10, 11, 16, although AQP4 silencing has been shown to worsen the pathological signs of diabetic retinopathy 9. These observations indicate that a possible role of AQP4 in retinal diseases deserves attention."
1302,PMC5742711,INTRO,paragraph,"Major diseases of the retina are those characterized by neovessel growth resulting from the accumulation of several proangiogenic and inflammatory factors in response to hypoxia among which VEGF plays a major role 17. In this respect, anti‐VEGF therapies are currently approved to treat proliferative retinopathies such as neovascular age‐related macular degeneration 18."
1303,PMC5742711,INTRO,paragraph,"There are findings indicating the possibility of an interplay between AQP4 and VEGF or that common mechanisms may participate in regulating AQP4 and VEGF expression. Indeed, increased production of both AQP4 and VEGF has been reported in the rodent retina in response to hypoxia or hyperglycaemia 8, 11, 14, 16. In addition, VEGF administration has been found to induce AQP4 expression, whereas decreasing VEGF results in reduced retinal levels of AQP4 11, 16. There is also evidence of functional interactions between AQP4 and hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1 (HIF‐1), the major transcription factor regulating VEGF levels in response to hypoxia 19. For instance, in rat models of cerebral oedema, AQP4 and HIF‐1 are concomitantly upregulated by hypoxia and the inhibition of HIF‐1 prevents AQP4 upregulation 20, 21."
1304,PMC5742711,INTRO,paragraph,"The mouse model of oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) represents a good model in which to study whether AQP4 may influence VEGF upregulation in response to hypoxia together with its downstream retinal damage 22. In this model, mice are exposed to hyperoxia from postnatal day (PD)7 to PD12 when, after returning to normoxia until PD17, they undergo to relative hypoxia that causes increased activity of HIF‐1 23. HIF‐1 is composed of a constitutively expressed β‐subunit (HIF‐1β) and an oxygen‐regulated α‐subunit (HIF‐1α). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF‐1α is stabilized reaching levels that are determined by a balance in positive and negative feedback mechanisms in which NO production plays an important role 24 through increased levels of the inducible form of NOS (iNOS) 24. After HIF‐1α stabilization, HIF‐1α and HIF‐1β translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus where they form a heterodimer that binds to the HBS localized to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the promoter of HIF‐1 target genes 25. There is indication that in models of ocular neovascular diseases, the induction of VEGF occurs through the HRE in the VEGF gene promoter as HRE deletion prevents the hypoxia‐induced VEGF upregulation 26. In addition, it has been reported that hypoxia‐induced erythropoietin gene expression is dependent on the methylation status of HBS, when HBS is methylated, its binding with HIF‐1 is abolished 27. Finally, the methylation of CpG sites in the VEGF gene promoter results in reduced HIF‐1‐driven VEGF expression in the human placenta after preeclampsia and in tongue carcinoma cells in response to hypoxia 28, 29, thus suggesting that something similar might occur in in vivo models of hypoxia‐driven neovascular diseases of the retina."
1305,PMC5742711,INTRO,paragraph,"In this study, we investigate the role of AQP4 on hypoxia‐induced VEGF upregulation with the resulting neovessel growth and ERG dysfunction that characterize the OIR model. To this aim, retinal level of AQP4, VEGF, HIF‐1α, iNOS, NO as well as retinal neovascularization and function was determined in OIR models from WT and AQP4 KO mice. Furthermore, the methylation status of the HBS in the VEGF gene promoter and the physical interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS was analysed in both strains under hypoxic conditions."

1308,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"AQP4 KO mice with a CD1 genetic background and age‐matched CD1 mice used as WT mice were kindly provided by Dr. Hu (Nanjing Medical University, China). Genotyping was performed on tail DNA using standard protocols. Mice were housed in a regulated environment (23 ± 1°C, 50 ± 5% humidity) with a 12‐hrs light/dark cycle (lights on at 8.00 a.m.), provided with food and water ad libitum, and supplied with environmental enrichment materials, such as toys and shelters. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and adheres to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Procedures were carried in compliance with the Italian guidelines for animal care (DL 116/92) and the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Universities of Pisa and Bari. All efforts were made to reduce both animal suffering and the number of animals used. Experiments were performed on a total of 92 mouse pups of both sexes, which were killed at PD17. In some experiments, mice at PD12 (16 animals) were also used. In all experiments, mice were anaesthetized with 4% halothane, killed by cervical dislocation and the eyes were enucleated."

Oxygen was checked twice daily with an oxygen analyzer (Pro‐Custom Elettronica, Milano, Italy). Individual litters were reared in either oxygen or room air (controls). All experiments were performed at the same time of the day to exclude possible circadian influences. The data were collected from both males and females and the results combined, as there was no apparent sex difference."

1312,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"After mice death, retinal tissues were rapidly dissected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until analysis. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), purified, resuspended in RNase‐free water and quantified using a fluorometer (Qubit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). First‐strand cDNA was generated from 1 μg of total RNA (QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit; Qiagen). In quantitative real‐time RT‐PCR (qPCR) experiments, five independent samples for each experimental condition, each containing two retinas from two different mice either WT or AQP4 KO, were used. qPCR experiments were performed using a kit (iQ Sybr Green Supermix; Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), and primer sets were obtained from Primer Bank (AQP4 and VEGF) 31 or RTPrimerDB (Rpl13a) 32. The primer set for VEGF was designed to match the VEGF isoforms expressed in the retina. Forward and reverse primers were chosen to hybridize to unique regions of the appropriate gene sequence. Their sequences are shown in Table 1. Primer amplification efficiency (Opticon Monitor 3 software; Bio‐Rad Laboratories) was close to 100%. Target genes were run concurrently with Rpl13a, a stable housekeeping gene in the OIR model 33. Samples were compared using the relative threshold cycle (Ct Method) 34. The increase (x‐fold) was determined relative to a control after normalizing to Rpl13a. All reactions were run in triplicate. After statistical analysis, the data from the different experiments were plotted and averaged in the same graph."

1314,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"In Western blot experiments, five independent samples for each experimental condition, each containing two retinas from two different mice either WT or AQP4 KO, were used. Retinal samples were processed as previously reported 34 obtaining supernatants containing cytosolic proteins (used to detect VEGF, HIF‐1α, iNOS and nitrite production) or membrane proteins (used to detect AQP4). Nuclear proteins were obtained using a commercially available kit (Nuclear Extraction Kit; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Protein concentration was determined using a fluorometer (Qubit; Invitrogen). Equal amounts (30 μg) of proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Bio‐Rad Laboratories). β‐actin or histone H3 was used as loading controls. The blots were blocked in 3% skim milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies, followed by 1‐hr incubation at RT with secondary antibodies. Key features of the antibodies are summarized in Table 2. Blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The optical density of the bands was normalized to the level of β‐actin or histone H3 as specified. All experiments were run in duplicate.

1320,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"The retinal vasculature was visualized by immunohistochemistry on retinal whole mounts in line with previous works 22. Briefly, the retinal whole mounts were freeze‐thawed and incubated overnight at 4°C in fluorescein labelled isolectin B4 (1:200; Vector Laboratories, Burlingmae, CA, USA). Retinal whole mounts were examined for changes in their vascular pattern with a microscope equipped with epifluorescence (Eclipse Ni‐E; Nikon, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Images of the retinal vasculature were acquired through a digital photocamera (DS‐Fi1c camera; Nikon) and processed using an image‐editing software (Adobe Photoshop; Adobe Systems, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) to create whole retina montages in which the extent of the avascular area and the total area of pre‐retinal neovascular tufts were measured according to previous quantification studies 34. For each experimental condition, quantitative data originated from six retinas from six different mice either WT or AQP4 KO."
1321,PMC5742711,METHODS,title_2,Electroretinography
1322,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"Retinal function was examined with scotopic full‐field ERG as previously reported 35. After dark‐adaptation overnight, ERG responses were recorded from both eyes together using silver/silver chloride ring electrodes inserted under the lower eyelids, forehead reference electrode, and ground electrode in the tail. Pupils were fully dilated using 0.5% atropine. The cornea was intermittently irrigated with saline solution to maintain the baseline recording. Body temperature was maintained at 38°C by a heating pad. Mixed (rod and cone) responses were evoked by flashes of different light intensities ranging from −3.4 to 1 log cd‐s/m2 generated through a Ganzfeld stimulator (Biomedica Mangoni, Pisa, Italy). The electrodes were connected to a two‐channel amplifier. Signals were amplified at 1000 gain and bandpass filtered between 0.2 and 500 Hz before being digitized at 5 kHz rate with a data acquisition device (Biomedica Mangoni). The ERG waveforms were examined primarily for amplitude information, and the data (pooled and reported as mean amplitudes ± S.E.M. in μV) were graphed to determine any gross changes in the intensity‐response function for that eye. Intensity‐response functions of the b‐wave were fit to a modified Naka‐Rushton function 36 V(I) = V0 + (Vmax·In)/(In + kn). In this equation, V is the amplitude of the b‐wave (in μV), I is the stimulus intensity (in log cd‐s/m2), V0 is the non‐zero baseline effect, Vmax is the saturated amplitude of the b‐wave (in μV), k is the stimulus intensity that evokes a b‐wave of half‐maximum amplitude (in log cd‐s/m2), n, which was constrained to unity, is a dimensionless constant controlling the slope of the function and represents the degree of heterogeneity of retinal sensitivity. To demonstrate oscillatory potentials (OPs), ERG responses were digitally filtered with bandpass filter between 65 and 300 Hz to eliminate the a‐ and b‐wave interference and to avoid the 60 Hz line noise. Of the five OPs that can generally be isolated from the mouse ERG, only OP2, OP3 and OP4 were analysed as OP1, and OP5 could not be accurately measured at PD17 37. For each OP, the trough‐to‐peak amplitude was measured and the amplitudes of each wavelet were added to create the sum OPs (SOPs = OP2 + OP3 + OP4; 38). Mean amplitudes of ERG responses were plotted as a function of increasing light intensities. For each experimental condition, ERG analysis was performed on six mice either WT or AQP4 KO."
1323,PMC5742711,METHODS,title_2,Analysis of DNA methylation
1324,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"For each experimental condition, genomic DNA was extracted from the retinas of four mice either WT or AQP4 KO mice, killed at PD12 or PD17, using a kit (DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit; Qiagen). Bisulphite reaction was performed (EpiTect Bisulfite Kit; Qiagen) to deaminate unmethylated cytosine to produce uracil in DNA. Purified bisulphite‐treated DNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). To search for CpG sites, the promoter of mouse VEGF (GenBank: U41383.1) was analysed by MethPrimer 39. The online available ZymoResearch Software (http://www.zymoresearch.com/tools/bisulfite-primer-seeker) was used to design primers for bisulphite sequencing. Their sequences are shown in Table 1. Fifty nanogram of bisulphite treated and purified DNA was PCR amplified using these primers and High Fidelity Taq DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR products were analysed by 2% agarose gel, and amplicons were eluted by QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced. FinchTV version 1.5.0 (free program from Geospiza, inc.) was used to analyse sequences and to detect double peaks (C/T). All unmethylated cytosines (C) were sequenced as thymine (T) and the presence of a C‐peak indicated the presence of 5mC in the genome. The presence of both C‐ and T‐peaks indicated partial methylation, and the height of C peaks was proportional to methylation frequency. The methylation frequency of the CpG site in the HBS was quantified in retinas at PD12. The Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) of the HBS was performed as reported previously 40. Briefly, 300 ng of PCR products containing the HBS was digested overnight at 37°C with HPYcH4IV restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA), which is selective for methylated HBS. Restriction fragments were analysed by 2.5% agarose gel, calculating the % of methylated sequences with ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/; provided in the public domain by the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Methylation frequencies of the CpG1 site (inside the HBS) and three CpG sites (CpG2, 3 and 4) proximal to the HBS were measured by the cloning and sequencing approach, performed as follows. Eight post‐bisulphite PCR products were equimolar pooled (four WT and four AQP4 KO) and cloned into pcR2.1 Topo‐TA vector using Top10 competent cells (Life Technologies). Independent clones were fully sequenced and aligned to reveal C (methylated C in genome) or T (demethylated C in genome) in the CpG1 of the HBS (TACGTGGG) and in CpG2‐4 in the same PCR product."

1327,PMC5742711,METHODS,paragraph,"ChIP was performed using the MAGnify Chromatin Immunoprecipitation System kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Life Thechnologies) with significant modification relative to the amount of starting material and chromatin fragmentation conditions. Each sample was composed of two retinas from the same mouse. Retinas were explanted at PD12 after 1 and 6 hrs of hypoxia and at PD17, immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until the chromatin preparation. Samples were thawed on ice and homogenized with a sterile 1‐ml syringe and a 1.5‐inch 20G needle in 75 μl of ice‐cold D‐PBS. Sixty microlitre of room temperature D‐PBS was added to the homogenized tissue off the ice. To fix the samples and crosslink the chromatin, 4 μl of 37% formaldehyde was added and samples were incubated for 10 min. at RT, swirling the tube every 2 min. The crosslink was quenched with 17 μl of 1.25 M glycine for 5 min. at RT, and cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000× g for 3 min. at 4°C), washed twice with 150 μl of ice‐cold D‐PBS. The pellet was extracted on ice with 80 μl of lysis buffer and protease inhibitor provided in the kit. Chromatin shearing was performed with Vibra‐Cell Sonics VC‐130 for 10 cycles on ice (20 sec. of sonication at 25% amplitude followed by 20 sec. rest on ice) to obtain an average smear of 1 Kbp. Chromatin shearing was checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 10 μl of Dynabeads Protein A/G, 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal Anti‐HIF‐1α ChIP Grade antibody (ab2185; Abcam) or control rabbit IgG provided in the kit and 15 μl of sheared chromatin with 10 r.p.m. rotation at 4°C over night. DNA from 1.5 μl of input chromatin (10% of immunoprecipitated chromatin) was purified and used in the subsequent qPCR as input sample.

The percentage input method was used to measure the HIF‐1α binding to the HBS. Briefly, starting from the Ct obtained from amplification plots relative to the input, to the control IgG ChIP and to the HIF‐1α ChIP, the IgG‐normalized input percentage was calculated (input percentage relative to HIF‐1α ChIP—input percentage relative to IgG ChIP).

VEGF proteins as evaluated by Western blot were drastically increased by hypoxia (about 130% in WT mice, P < 0.001 and about 70% in AQP4 KO mice, P < 0.01). As evaluated by ELISA, hypoxia increased VEGF levels (about 450% in WT mice, P < 0.001 and about 160% in AQP4 KO mice, P < 0.01). Figure 2D shows that hypoxia increased HIF‐1α proteins by about 225% in WT mice (P < 0.01) and by about 735% in AQP4 KO mice (P < 0.001). We checked whether increased HIF‐1α accumulation in the absence of AQP4 might depend on an impaired migration of HIF‐1α from the cytosol to the nucleus. Representative blots depicting cytosolic and nuclear HIF‐1α are shown in Figure 2E. The densitometric analysis of Figure 2F demonstrates that the ratios between nuclear and cytosolic levels of HIF‐1α did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice. Measurements of iNOS proteins and NO production in response to hypoxia shown in Figure 3 demonstrate that iNOS increased by about 70% in WT mice (P < 0.01), whereas it was not influenced by hypoxia in AQP4 KO mice. Consistently, hypoxia increased NO production by about 110% (P < 0.001) in WT mice, while no effects were found in AQP4 KO mice."

1346,PMC5742711,RESULTS,paragraph,"We investigated in retinas from AQP4 KO mice whether the lower VEGF accumulation in response to hypoxia might be associated with changes in the CpG methylation status in the VEGF gene promoter. In a first set of experiments, direct PCR bisulphite sequencing was used to analyse the methylation status of 23 CpG sites in 4 DNA regions belonging to the VEGF promoter and the 5′ UTR. In particular, we analysed 11 single CpG sites, including the CpG site contained in the HBS 41 (CpG1), as well as 12 CpG sites contained in a 5′UTR CpG island. Figure 6A shows that after 5 days of hypoxia (PD17), 4 CpG sites (CpG1 in the HBS and three other nearby CpG sites, CpG2, CpG3 and CpG4) were methylated in both WT and AQP4 KO mice, while the CpG sites in the remaining DNA regions were almost completely demethylated in the two strains. In Figure 6B, the chromatograms that are representative of the methylation status of CpG1‐4 are shown. It can be noticed that the methylation status of CpG1‐4 did not differ between WT and AQP4 KO mice with CpG3 that was methylated in both normoxia and hypoxia, while CpG1, 2 and 4 that were demethylated in normoxia, but methylated in hypoxia. This finding demonstrates that at PD17, there was no difference in the methylation status between WT and AQP4 KO mice although, in the absence of AQP4, mRNA levels of VEGF were lower than in its presence."

1348,PMC5742711,RESULTS,paragraph,"Considering that HBS demethylation is required to allow HIF‐1α interaction with the HBS 27, that this interaction should precede VEGF production 41 and that retinal levels of HIF‐1α and VEGF are maximally upregulated in response to hypoxia over the first hours after the hypoxia onset 23, we can reasonably assume that in the OIR model, the interaction between HIF‐1 and the HBS should take place rapidly during the hypoxic response. In a first set of experiments, we evaluated VEGF expression at different times after the beginning of hypoxia in WT and AQP4 KO mice. We found that at 1 hr of hypoxia, the levels of VEGF mRNA were significantly lower than in normoxia. VEGF mRNA reached normoxic levels after 6 hrs of hypoxia to drastically increase at 12 hrs after then they were reduced by about 50%. We found that compared to the WT the absence of AQP4 had already reduced VEGF mRNA levels after 12 hrs of hypoxia when the VEGF accumulation was maximal (Fig. 7A). To test the possibility that hypoxia rapidly influences the methylation status of the HBS and to evaluate the effect of AQP4 absence, we investigated the methylation status of CpG1 after 1 hr of hypoxia. As shown in Figure 7B, in response to 1 hr of hypoxia, CpG1 was indeed demethlyated in WT mice, whereas it was methylated in AQP4 KO mice similarly to what found in both WT and AQP4 KO mice under normoxia. The COBRA analysis revealed that after 1 hr of hypoxia, the methylation frequency of CpG1 was about 30% lower in WT than in AQP4 KO mice (P < 0.05; Fig. 7C). An additional quantification of the methylation frequency of CpG1‐4 in the VEGF promoter was performed using the most accurate technique of cloning and sequencing of bisulphite‐treated DNA. Figure 7D shows that the methylation frequency of CpG1 in the HBS was about twofold lower in WT than in AQP4 KO mice (36% in WT versus 73% in AQP4 KO mice). Similarly, the methylation frequency of CpG2 is about 28% in WT and 54% in AQP4 KO mice. In contrast, CpG3 was almost completely methylated, and CpG4 strongly demethylated, in both WT and AQP4 KO mice without any difference between the two strains."

Due to the very low level of HIF‐1α measured in normoxia (Fig. 2D) and due to the almost absent interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS occurring in normoxia already reported in the literature 42, the ChIP‐qPCR analysis was here restricted to the hypoxic condition by comparing WT with AQP4 KO mice. As shown in Figure 7E, in WT mice, the interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS started quickly (in the first hour) and peaked after 6 hrs of hypoxia, whereas it had returned to levels measured after 1 hr of hypoxia at PD17.

1352,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
1353,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,This is the first demonstration that hypoxia induces HBS demethylation at level of VEGF promoter in vivo and that AQP4 deletion prevents this process. The lack of HBS demethylation would limit the accessibility of HIF‐1 to the VEGF gene promoter thus reducing the hypoxia‐induced VEGF gene transactivation and VEGF accumulation in response to hypoxia therefore preventing the retinal damage including pathological neovascularization and retinal dysfunction.
1354,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,title_2,Mechanisms underlying lower VEGF accumulation in AQP4 KO mice: HIF‐1α accumulation and translocation
1355,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,"As shown by the present results, in AQP4 KO mice, hypoxic conditions are coupled to lower retinal levels of VEGF as compared to WT mice thus indicating that AQP4 may have a detrimental role during ischaemic/hypoxic conditions of the retina. This is in line with the fact that AQP4 is overexpressed in the OIR model as demonstrated here, a finding which is consistent with previous results in rodent models of neovascular pathologies of the retina 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 16 and with the observation that AQP4 deletion ameliorates the pathological signs of retinal ischaemia 6."
1356,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In search for mechanisms underlying this reduced VEGF levels in response to hypoxia, we have first checked whether HIF‐1α levels may be in parallel reduced by the absence of AQP4 as VEGF and HIF‐1α levels are strictly interconnected 43. However, HIF‐1α is instead dramatically increased in response to hypoxia in AQP4 KO mice. One possibility to explain HIF‐1α overproduction in the absence of AQP4 would be to postulate that AQP4 deletion prevents NO accumulation in response to hypoxia, an event that is known to limit HIF‐1α stabilization in hypoxic conditions 24. As shown here, in the absence of AQP4, neither iNOS expression nor NO production is influenced by hypoxia thus explaining why HIF‐1α stabilization is out of control in the absence of NO overproduction. On the other hand, the lack of NO upregulation may directly cause reduced VEGF levels as NO is known to induce VEGF expression 44. In the OIR model, for instance, inhibition of iNOS has been observed to reduce retinal VEGF 45, 46. Conversely, VEGF may act as an upstream regulator of iNOS 47, thus indicating that reduced VEGF levels may cause reduced iNOS expression in response to hypoxia. Thus, the complex relationship between iNOS and VEGF is characterized by reciprocal interactions in which AQP4 may play a role, although its exact contribution and the mechanisms involved remain to be investigated."
1357,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,"An additional possibility to explain the reduced VEGF accumulation in response to hypoxia is that the translocation of HIF‐1α from the cytosol to the nucleus would be impaired in the absence of AQP4, thus limiting the availability of HIF‐1 to the HBS in the VEGF gene promoter and reducing HIF‐1 transcriptional activity. In this respect, proteins such as HIF hydroxylases may sequester HIF‐1α into the cytoplasm thus preventing its nuclear migration and reducing HIF‐1 transcriptional activity 48. This possibility, however, has been denied by the fact that the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of HIF‐1α is not influenced by AQP4 deletion although in the presence of a reduced HIF‐1 transcriptional activity."
1358,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,title_2,Mechanisms underlying lower VEGF accumulation in AQP4 KO mice: HBS demethylation and HIF‐1α binding
1359,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,"It is known that hypoxia induces CpG demethylation at the level of promoters of hypoxia‐regulated genes 49, 50 thus allowing the binding of transcription factors and gene transcription. For instance, HBS demethylation is a mandatory process to allow HIF‐1‐dependent erythropoietin gene expression 27. Little is known about the kinetic of CpG demethylation in the HBS and about the kinetic of the interaction with HIF‐1. Results in human neuroblastoma cells have demonstrated that the HBS in the VEGF promoter is demethylated after 24 hrs of hypoxia and that VEGF mRNA increases at 16 hrs of hypoxia strictly dependent on the enzymes involved in CpG demethylation 50 supporting the hypothesis that during the hypoxic response, a rapid CpG demethylation occurs at the HBS and that there is a tight correlation between hypoxia‐induced CpG demethylation and VEGF transactivation. In this respect, recent findings in rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells indicate that HIF‐1α binds the HBS within 1 hr of hypoxia, with a peak after 3 hrs 42. This result suggests that CpG demethylation at the HBS level, a mandatory process for HIF‐1 binding 27, occurs quickly in hypoxic conditions. More generally, there are also indications that the interaction between the VEGF promoter and hypoxia‐activated transcription factors occurs rapidly during the hypoxic response. For instance, phosphorylated STAT‐3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, a transcription factor participating to hypoxia‐mediated VEGF transactivation) binds to the VEGF promoter after 30 min. of hypoxia in retinal endothelial cells 51. However, little is known about these mechanisms in the hypoxic retina. There is evidence that HIF‐1α is regulated over time after the beginning of hypoxia with a peak of stabilization occurring at 2 hrs 23. In addition, VEGF mRNA is constitutively expressed in the inner nuclear layer where it drastically increases 6 hrs after the onset of hypoxia and remains elevated for several days 23. This is also confirmed here by the demonstration that maximal accumulation of VEGF mRNA takes places between 6 and 12 hrs of hypoxia. As also shown by the present results, 1 hr of hypoxia induces HBS demethylation at the level of the VEGF promoter in line with the time course of retinal accumulation of HIF‐1α and VEGF mRNA reported during the hypoxic response 23. The additional evidence from the present results that AQP4 deletion drastically reduces VEGF expression already after 12 hrs of hypoxia is indicative of the fact that mechanisms of VEGF transactivation might be influenced by AQP4 absence already after the first hours of hypoxia. In this line, we found that AQP4 deletion prevents the HBS demethylation process. To provide direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that the observed change in the HBS methylation status may affect HIF‐1 accessibility to the VEGF promoter, therefore influencing retinal levels of VEGF, we checked the physical interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS in the VEGF promoter. We show here for the first time in hypoxic retina that a physical interaction between HIF‐1α and the HBS occurs in the first hours of hypoxia and that this interaction is strongly affected by AQP4. The schematic diagram in Figure 8 shows the hypothetical sequence of events in normoxia and hypoxia in WT and AQP4 KO mice. We suggest that the absence of AQP4 reduces HBS demethylation limiting the accessibility of HIF‐1 to the VEGF gene promoter therefore reducing VEGF transcription and accumulation in response to hypoxia. As a consequence, neovascular tuft formation and ERG dysfunction, events downstream to VEGF upregulation in response to hypoxia, are prevented despite the hypoxic insult."

In both WT and AQP4 KO mice under normoxia, HIF‐1α is degradated and no VEGF transactivation occurs. In WT mice HIF‐1α is stabilized, interacts with HIF‐1β and binds the demethylated HBS localized in the VEGF promoter. In AQP4 KO mice, despite high levels of HIF‐1α, the absence of HBS demethylation prevents the HIF‐1 binding and the relative VEGF transactivation. Our assumption is that the absence of AQP4 reduces HBS demethylation limiting the accessibility of HIF‐1 to the VEGF gene promoter, therefore reducing VEGF transcription and accumulation in response to hypoxia."
1361,PMC5742711,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Taken together, the present results suggest a correlation between VEGF upregulation in response to hypoxia and HBS methylation status. AQP4 deletion would prevent VEGF upregulation presumably by interfering with hypoxia‐induced HBS demethylation process, thus reducing the physical interaction between HIF‐1 and the HBS. The additional observation that, in the absence of AQP4, iNOS, another HIF‐1 target gene, is not influenced by hypoxia suggests reduced demethylation processes as more general mechanisms of gene silencing through which AQP4 deletion may lead to decreased expression of HIF‐1 target genes in hypoxic conditions. How AQP4 regulates the mechanistic associations among VEGF, HIF‐1α and HBS demethylation is difficult to postulate as the mechanisms underlying the control of HBS demethylation process are still largely unknown 52. In this respect, understanding how a water channel may influence a site‐specific and hypoxia‐induced demethylation process will require further work and the use of different experimental models to exclude the possibility of off target effects due to the lack of AQP4 gene. In conclusion, although with the difficulty of explaining the mechanistic relationships between AQP4 and VEGF and in the presence of mostly descriptive results, the present work lays the ground for future investigations for clarifying these issues."

1374,PMC6025355,TITLE,front,A Caspase-3 Reporter for Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging of Single-Cell Apoptosis
1375,PMC6025355,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is a powerful imaging modality used to gather fluorescent reporter data independent of intracellular reporter intensity or imaging depth. We applied this technique to image real-time activation of a reporter for the proteolytic enzyme, caspase-3, in response to apoptotic cell death. This caspase-3 reporter activity provides valuable insight into cancer cell responsiveness to therapy and overall viability at a single-cell scale. Cleavage of a aspartate-glutamate-valine-aspartate (DEVD) linkage sequence alters Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) within the reporter, affecting its lifetime. Cellular apoptosis was quantified in multiple environments ranging from 2D flat and 3D spheroid cell culture systems to in vivo murine mammary tumor xenografts. We evaluated cell-by-cell apoptotic responses to multiple pharmacological and genetic methods of interest involved in cancer cell death. Within this article, we describe methods for measuring caspase-3 activation at single-cell resolution in various complex environments using FLIM."
1376,PMC6025355,INTRO,title_1,1. Introduction
1377,PMC6025355,INTRO,paragraph,"Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a tightly regulated cell suicide program that is critical during normal development and in cancer treatment. Apoptosis involves a signaling cascade that, ultimately, activates a family of proteases known as caspases. In response to various stimuli, apoptosis begins with the activation of “initiator” caspases, which cleave and activate “executioner” caspases (caspase-3, -6, and/or -7). Upon activation, these “executioner” caspases cleave various structural and repair proteins at the aspartate-glutamate-valine-aspartate (DEVD) amino acid sequence, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Current cytotoxic anticancer therapies commonly induce apoptosis of malignant cells. However, cancer cells can employ one or multiple mechanisms to evade apoptosis."
1378,PMC6025355,INTRO,paragraph,"Recent advances in fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent probe development have increased our understanding of cellular biology and cancer progression. Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one such technique that has greatly contributed to our understanding of protein interactions and signaling within a cell. FRET is a distance-dependent physical phenomenon by which energy is transferred from one excited fluorophore (also known as the donor) to a nearby acceptor, in this case, another nearby fluorophore. For FRET to occur between two fluorescent proteins, the emission spectrum of the donor molecule must overlap with the excitation spectrum of the acceptor. Since this reaction is distance-dependent, FRET can be used to determine interactions of proteins or protein domains of up to a distance of 10–100 Å. FRET is typically measured ratiometrically, using the relative fluorescence intensities of the excited donor and acceptor proteins. Efficient FRET is defined as a reduction of donor fluorescence relative to acceptor fluorescence. However, intensity-based FRET can be distorted by relative concentrations of donor and acceptor molecules, sample movement, excitation fluctuation, as well as the wavelength-dependent differences in attenuation and scattering of light in tissues."
1379,PMC6025355,INTRO,paragraph,"To overcome deficiencies common to ratiometric FRET, we, and others, have employed fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to quantify FRET. FLIM measures changes in fluorescence lifetime based on phase delay and the modulation ratio of light emitted from a fluorescent molecule relative to the excitation light. The lifetime of a fluorophore is the measure of time an excited fluorophore stays in an excited state before returning to its ground state. FRET interactions shorten the fluorescence lifetime of a donor fluorophore. FLIM offers several advantages over other imaging techniques for quantifying FRET. Primarily, unlike intensity-based ratiometric quantification, the fluorescence lifetime of a molecule is independent of the probe concentration or tissue depth. Therefore, this technique is better suited for 3D and in vivo models. FLIM also helps eliminate problems of bleed-through fluorescence from the donor molecule or direct excitation of the acceptor."
1380,PMC6025355,INTRO,paragraph,"Here, we used FLIM to monitor a caspase-3 FRET imaging reporter to quantify apoptosis in in vitro and in vivo models. The specifics of the FRET pair, LSS-mOrabge and mKate2, have been previously described. The caspase-3 reporter is engineered to link LSS-mOrange (donor) and mKate2 (acceptor) fluorescent molecules through the canonical DEVD sequence recognized by the caspase-3 enzyme. LSS-mOrange represents the ideal donor as the long Stokes shift can easily separate the excitation of LSS-mOrange from mKate2, while still providing a large spectral overlap for FRET to occur. In cells that do not activate caspase-3, the reporter remains intact and allows FRET to occur upon excitation of LSS-mOrange, reducing its lifetime. Cells that activate caspase-3 cleave the DEVD sequence that links LSS-mOrange and mKate2, causing the two fluorescent proteins to separate and the lifetime of LSS-mOrange increases. Therefore, cells that undergo apoptosis will display reduced FRET, which correlates to a longer lifetime of LSS-mOrange."
1381,PMC6025355,INTRO,paragraph,"In the following protocol, we describe in detail the necessary steps to measure apoptosis via FLIM-FRET in different experimental models and in response to various treatments. The first protocol explains how to generate cells that contain the LSSmOrange-DEVD-mKate2 apoptosis imaging reporter, as well as the appropriate control cells. We use these cells to describe how to detect apoptosis levels in 2D cell culture, 3D spheroids, and in vivo mouse models. We describe useful genetic perturbations, as well as pharmaceutical drugs, as a means to alter apoptosis. We also list selected methods to validate imaging data acquired for caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. Overall, the imaging methods described here offer new opportunities to investigate cell apoptosis at the single cell level in both 2D and 3D systems, which can enhance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance."

Other cell lines may be used for constitutive expression and experiments at investigators’ discretions. First, we outline the creation of the lentiviral vector, LSS-mOrange pLVX IRES blasticidin, and the PiggyBac transposon vector, LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2. Stably-expressing cell lines are created by inserting the vectors into cells. Finally, we describe how to select for a population of uniformly-expressing cells required for fluorescence experiments with the desired reporters through blasticidin drug selection or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)."

1531,PMC6025355,METHODS,paragraph,"Using an 820 nm wavelength, excite the LSS-mOrange fluorescent protein. We found a 256 × 256-pixel image with a 100 μs dwell time over 15–30 frames allow for sufficient counts and accurate data."
1532,PMC6025355,METHODS,paragraph,LSS-mOrange is a long stokes shift fluorescent protein and emits in the orange channel (572 nm). Acquire and measure fluorescence lifetime of molecules in the orange channel. Literature reports the known LSS-mOrange lifetime as 2.75 ± 0.07 ns.
1533,PMC6025355,METHODS,paragraph,"After imaging the samples of interest, open and analyze images with ISS VistaVision or similar processing software. Using the Multi-Image Phasor Analysis function, set the minimum threshold count to eliminate background data and the Gaussian smoothing operation to 3 to smooth acquired data while maintaining spatial accuracy."
1534,PMC6025355,METHODS,paragraph,"Use the phasor plot and ROI function to define the portion of pixels with an increased LSS-mOrange lifetime. Pseudocolor this population as red and the shorter lifetime pixels as yellow with another ROI. Cells displaying increased amounts of yellow or red indicate increased or decreased amounts of apoptosis, respectively. Detailed reports on fluorescence lifetime analysis using phasor plots have been previously published."
1535,PMC6025355,RESULTS,title_1,6. Results
1536,PMC6025355,RESULTS,paragraph,"FRET between LSS-mOrange and mKate2 will cause the higher-energy donor fluorescent protein (LSS-mOrange) to have a shorter fluorescence lifetime. Energy transfer between these two molecules will occur if they are spatially close to one another, as shown in the intact reporter construct. Once the DEVD sequence has been cleaved by caspase-3 during apoptosis, the LSS-mOrange and mKate2 FRET pair spatially separate. Separation of these proteins minimizes energy transfer from LSS-mOrange to mKate-2 and increases the donor’s lifetime (Figure 1)."
1537,PMC6025355,RESULTS,paragraph,"In Protocols 2 and 4, we discuss multiple experimental setups and imaging protocols, respectively. We expect the LSS-mOrange control cells to display a longer fluorescence lifetime than cells expressing fused LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 due to the lack of energy being transferred from the donor protein. Any treatment that causes apoptotic cell death will display an increased fraction of cells with a longer lifetime of LSS-mOrange due to cleavage at DEVD sites. The shift to the longer lifetime of LSS-mOrange occurs in 2D environments with increasing amounts of BAX-encoding plasmid, decreasing the availability of essential nutrients, and treating with different concentrations of pro-apoptotic drugs (Figure 2). The 3D spheroid and murine models will also display the same patterns; groups treated with trametinib will display increased apoptosis over their vehicle control."
1538,PMC6025355,RESULTS,paragraph,Protocol 3 details how to perform a metabolic flux assay on cells used in the FLIM studies. We used the commercially available metabolic flux assay and glucose stress test along with the Seahorse Bioscience XFe analyzer. These data can be correlated with a 2D nutrient deprivation study and subsequent FLIM imaging of the LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 reporter. Metabolically active cells with increased rates of both oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification will display less apoptotic cell death.
1539,PMC6025355,RESULTS,paragraph,"Future implications of this technology include screening for compounds that induce cellular apoptosis in cancer cells. While cells in 2D environments may present with morphological changes when beginning to undergo apoptosis, it is more difficult to visualize these changes in cells in 3D environments. The usefulness of FRET apoptosis reporter constructs is highlighted by the recent use of a similar construct to detect caspase-3 activation in a mouse xenograft model. This reporter allows for efficient screening of apoptosis in complex environments and we have previously used this reporter to quantify apoptosis in 3D and mouse models of breast cancer."
1540,PMC6025355,FIG,fig_caption,"Schematic representation of the LSS-mOrange-DEVD-mKate2 reporter. The intact DEVD linker between LSS-mOrange and mKate2 causes the two fluorescent proteins to be spatially close and experience increased FRET. This increase in FRET causes a decrease in the donor (LSS-mOrange) lifetime. Once the DEVD linker is enzymatically cleaved by active caspase-3, LSS-mOrange and mKate2 can spatially separate. This causes FRET to decrease and the donor (LSS-mOrange) lifetime to increase."

1557,PMC6274503,TITLE,front,Chemical Constituents of Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia (Kunth) Meisn (Polygonaceae) and Its In Vitro α-Amilase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities
1558,PMC6274503,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The phytochemical investigation of Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia, collected in Loja-Ecuador, led to the isolation of nine known compounds identified as: lupeol acetate (1); cis-p-coumaric acid (2); lupeol (3); β-sitosterol (4) trans-p-coumaric acid (5); linoleic acid (6) (+)-catechin (7); afzelin (8) and quercitrin (9). The structures of the isolated compounds were determined based on analysis of NMR and MS data, as well as comparison with the literature. The hypoglycemic activity of crude extracts and isolated compounds was assessed by the ability to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. The hexane extract showed weak inhibitory activity on α-amylase, with an IC50 value of 625 µg·mL−1, while the other extracts and isolated compounds were inactive at the maximum dose tested. The results on α-glucosidase showed more favorable effects; the hexanic and methanolic extracts exhibited a strong inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 48.22 µg·mL−1 and 19.22 µg·mL−1, respectively. Four of the nine isolated compounds exhibited strong inhibitory activity with IC50 values below 8 µM, much higher than acarbose (377 uM). Linoleic acid was the most potent compound (IC50 = 0.42 µM) followed by afzelin, (+)-catechin and quercitrin."
1559,PMC6274503,INTRO,title_1,1. Introduction
1560,PMC6274503,INTRO,paragraph,"Diabetes is defined as a complex metabolic disorder that affects protein, carbohydrate and fat metabolism, all due to insulin insufficiency or insulin dysfunction. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disease affects more than 382 million people around the world. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia factors, increased in diabetes, are involved in the cardiovascular failures that frequently affect patients. Diabetes is considered a public health problem, affecting people in both developed and developing countries, with no difference of race. According to the diabetes country profiles, diabetes mellitus accounts for 4% of total deaths in Ecuador, and ranks sixth in the population’s death causes, followed by respiratory diseases. For this reason, it is a priority issue for public health that needs the attention of both the government and academy. Folk medicine is well recognized in Ecuador, where almost 80% of the population uses plants as their primary source for medical treatment. Several plants are successfully used as antidiabetics in traditional medicine, and the WHO has recommended the assessment of these plants and their product derivatives for their potential use as oral therapy. A scientific validation of medicinal plants is necessary in order to prove efficiency, potency and security. Although many plants have beneficial effects, they can also be toxic, especially in long treatments such as those required in antidiabetic therapies. One of the therapeutic approaches used to treat diabetes consists of the inhibition of enzymes, which can hydrolyze the polysaccharides and convert them into simple sugars. This type of enzyme, such as alpha-amylase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the α-1-4-d-glycosidic linkage of glucose polymers such as starch. Αlpha-glucosidase acts by hydrolyzing disaccharides to glucose. Inhibitors of these enzymes can interrupt the absorption of glucose in the digestive tract, prolonging the carbohydrate digestion time and decreasing the rate of glucose absorption. As a consequence, the postprandial blood glucose level is lowered. For this reason, both alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assays have been extensively used to test drugs and plant extracts."
1561,PMC6274503,INTRO,paragraph,"Polygonaceae is a family characterized for the production of a large variety of secondary metabolites, many of which exhibit potential pharmacological activity, such as anthraquinones, naphthalenes, stilbenoids, steroids, glycosylated flavonoids, leucoanthocyanidins and phenolic acids, among others. Some species have been reported to have antidiabetic potential, such as Muehlenbeckia sagittifolia, Coccoloba uvifera, Rumex spp. and Rheum spp.. In Ecuador, this family accounts for nine genera and 42 species. The genus Muehlenbeckia is restricted to South America, Australia and New Zealand and includes ornamental and medicinal species. These species are frequently used to treat gastric ulcers, and are used as macerated leaves to treat kidney ailments and as infusions to relieve the pain of arthritis."
1562,PMC6274503,INTRO,paragraph,"Phytochemical studies for species belonging to this genus have been reported. Glycosylated flavonoids such as catechin and quercitrin, isolated from M. platyclada, have shown antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities. A series of anthraquinones such as emodin, physcion and emodin-8-β-d-idopyranoside, isolated from the leaves of M. hastulata, showed promising antioxidant activity measured by the DPPH method."
1563,PMC6274503,INTRO,paragraph,"Muehlenbeckia tamnifolia (Kunth) Meisn, known as Anku yuyu lutu yuyu, is used by indigenous communities in Ecuador to treat kidney diseases, in baths to relieve bone pain, as mouthwash for toothache and, in combination with other plants, to treat bumps and inflammation. It is also applied as a disinfectant and to treat purulent skin wounds. Previous chemical studies on the roots of M. tamnifolia showed the presence of anthraquinones such as chrysophanic acid and emodin. The aim of this work was to evaluate the inhibitory activities of different extracts and isolated compounds of M. tamnifolia on α-amylase and α-glucosidase."
1564,PMC6274503,RESULTS,title_1,2. Results and Discussion
1565,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The phytochemical study of M. tamnifolia led to the isolation and identification of nine compounds, whose structures are shown in Figure 1. The spectral properties of these known compounds, including 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR data, were identical to those previously described in the literature. Among the species of this genus, (+)-catechin (7) and quercitrin (9) have been reported only in M. platyclada. Lupeol acetate (1), cis-p-coumaric acid (2), lupeol (3), β-sitosterol (4), trans-p-coumaric acid (5), linoleic acid (6) and afzelin (8) are reported here for the first time in this genus."
1566,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 1 shows the presence of an acetyl group as a singlet at 2.05 ppm, typical of the methyl bonded to a carboxyl group. The 13C-NMR shows a signal at 173.8 ppm, consistent with the carbon atom of an ester group, and a signal at 21.4 ppm corresponding to the methyl group of an acetyl derivative. The remaining 1H- and 13C-NMR signals are similar to those obtained for compound 3."
1567,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 2 (Figure 1) displayed two doublets, one at 7.63 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz) and 6.79 (2H, d, J = 8.8 Hz) ppm, typical of a 1,4-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets at 6.83 (1H, J = 12.5 Hz) and 5.82 (1H, J = 12.5 Hz) ppm revealed the presence of a cis olefin coupling, corresponding to H-7 and H-8 in the proposed structure. The above spectral features are in close agreement to those observed for cis-p-coumaric acid."
1568,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 3 shows six singlets, corresponding to tertiary methyl groups, between 0.75 and 1.02 ppm and a singlet at 1.25 ppm, typical of a methyl group in an isopropenyl system.

1570,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1H-NMR spectrum acquired for compound 5 (Figure 1) was almost identical to that of cis-p-coumaric acid (2), suggesting a close structural similarity between these two compounds. The difference is found in two doublets (J = 16.0 Hz) centered at 7.64 and 6.29 ppm which suggest the trans-derivative of compound 2."
1571,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,Compound 6 was characterized using GC-MS. Peak identification was carried out by comparing the recorded mass spectra with those present in the instrument library (WILEY 7n.l).
1572,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"The 1H-NMR spectrum of compound 7 shows three signals corresponding to aromatic protons at 6.72, 6.76 and 6.83, corresponding to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted ring. The spectrum also shows the signals of two aromatic proton signals at 5.85 and 5.93 ppm, typical of a 1,2,3,5-tetrasubstituted ring. Two oxygenated methine protons signals are located at 3.97 and 4.56 ppm, consistent with H-3 and H-2 in the structure of catechin, respectively. Moreover, two methylenic diastereotopic proton signals can be observed at 2.55 and 2.87 ppm, which is consistent with position 4 of catechin. The 13C-NMR spectrum and DEPT experiment show five oxygenated quaternary aromatic signals at 157.8, 157.6, 156.9, 146.2 and 146.2 ppm, two non-oxygenated quaternary aromatic signals at 132.2 and 100.8 ppm, and five CH aromatic signals at 120.0, 116.1, 115.2, 96.3 and 95.5 ppm. Two oxygenated methine carbons signals at 82.8 and 68.8 ppm and one methylene carbon signal at 28.5 ppm are also present.

1575,PMC6274503,RESULTS,title_2,α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibition Activity
1576,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,In the α-amylase assay only the hexanic extract was active at the maximum dose tested (625 μg/mL with a sample solution of 10 mg/mL). The other extracts and compounds exhibited inhibition percentages less than 35% at the tested conditions and were not included in this report.
1577,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"For the α-glucosidase assay, both hexanic and methanolic extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity and only four compounds were active. Three of them belonging to the flavonoid family and one belonging to the essential fatty acids group exhibited strong inhibitory activity, with IC50 values below than 8 μM (Table 1). Their inhibitory activities were even 48.5- to 754-fold higher than the commercial drug Acarbose (IC50 = 377 μM). The remaining five compounds exhibited no inhibitory activity over α-glucosidase at the maximum dose tested (less than 1% of enzyme inhibition) and only trans-p-coumaric acid exhibited 27% of enzyme inhibition. The activity of Afzelin (Kaempferol 3-O-rhamnoside) was 20-fold higher compared to the activity reported by Ajish et al., who obtained an IC50 value of 81.16 μM. The method described previously in the methodology measures the pNP released during 60 min which allows us to obtain more reliable data by measuring enzymatic catalysis for a long period of time instead of short periods or even end point measurements. Additionally, using a high amount of enzyme can greatly affect the IC50 value obtained."
1578,PMC6274503,RESULTS,paragraph,"Moreover, the flavonoids have demonstrated to be moderate to strong inhibitors of α-glucosidase, with IC50 values below 100 μM. Linoleic acid was demonstrated to be the most potent compound, followed by afzelin, (+)-catechin and quercitrin. PUFA (polyunsatured fatty acids) have been demonstrated to be good inhibitors of glucosidase, exhibiting different types of inhibition and potency, as demonstrated by Liu et al., where C18 unsaturated fatty acids where more active versus longer fatty acid chains with more double bonds (or even no double bonds). The α-glucosidase inhibitors acting toward enzymes in the intestine have been shown to effectively delay the blood glucose level, lowering glucose absorption."

1601,PMC6274503,METHODS,paragraph,"The inhibitory activity is measured according to the method reported by Xiao et al. with slight modifications. Acarbose was used as the positive control. Starch solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g in 50 mL of 0.4 M NaOH and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. After cooling in iced water, the solution pH was adjusted to 7 with 2 M HCl and H2O was added to complete 100 mL. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH:H2O (50:50).

PBS solution (35 μL), substrate (35 μL) and sample (5 μL) solutions were mixed in a 96-well microtiter plate, and the mixture was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 1 min. Then, 20 μL of a 50 μg/mL α-amylase solution was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μL of 0.1 M HCl and then 150 μL of 0.5 mM iodine solution (0.5 mM I2 and 0.5 mM KI) were added. The absorbance was measured in a microplate reader (EPOCH 2, Biotek Instruments Inc. Winoosky, VT, USA) at 580 nm.

1603,PMC6274503,METHODS,paragraph,"α-Glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined using a 96-well microtiter plate with p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside as the substrate, according to the method describe by Tao et al., with slight modifications. Sample solutions were prepared by dissolving 10 mg in 1 mL MeOH:H2O (50:50). Several dilutions in PBS were made in case of getting complete enzyme inhibition. First, 75 μL of PBS (SIGMA-P4417) was mixed with 5 μL of the sample and 20 μL of the enzyme solution (0.15 U/mL in PBS pH 7.4), then it was pre-incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to the initiation of the reaction by adding the substrate. After pre-incubation, 20 μL of PNPG (5 mM in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) was added and then incubated at 37 °C. The amount of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) released was measured in an EPOCH 2 (BIOTEK®) microplate reader at 405 nm for 60 min, recording the absorbance every 5 min. The results were expressed as inhibition percentage by means of the formula described by Choi et al. as follows:  where A0 is the absorbance recorded for the enzymatic activity without inhibitor (control), and As is the absorbance recorded for the enzymatic activity in presence of the inhibitor (sample). IC50 value was calculated by curve fitting of data (GraphPad Prism 5.0). Acarbose was used as positive control."

1636,PMC6949429,TITLE,front,Structure of the human metapneumovirus polymerase phosphoprotein complex
1637,PMC6949429,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Summary paragraph
1638,PMC6949429,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) cause severe respiratory diseases in infants and elder adults. Neither a vaccine nor an effective antiviral therapy exists to control RSV or HMPV infections. During viral genome replication and transcription, the tetrameric phosphoprotein P serves as a crucial adaptor between the nucleoprotein-RNA (N-RNA) template and the L protein, which has RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), GDP polyribonucleotidyltransferase (PRNTase) and cap-specific methyltransferases (MTases) activities. How P interacts with L and mediates association with the free form of N and with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) is not clear for HMPV or other prominent human pathogens including measles, Ebola and rabies viruses. Here, we report a cryo-EM reconstruction showing the ring-shaped structure of the polymerase and capping domains of HMPV L, bound with a tetramer of P. The connector and MTase domains are mobile with respect to the core. The putative priming loop important for initiation of RNA synthesis is fully retracted, leaving space in the active-site cavity for RNA elongation. P interacts extensively with the N-terminal region of L, burying more than 4,016 Å2 of molecular surface area in the interface. Two of the four helices forming the coiled-coil tetramerization domain of P, and long C-terminal extensions projecting from these two helices, wrap around the L protein like tentacles. The structural versatility of the four P protomers, which are largely disordered in their free state, demonstrates an example of a “folding-upon-partner-binding” mechanism for carrying-out P adaptor functions. The structure shows that P has the potential to modulate multiple functions of L and should accelerate the design of specific antiviral drugs."
1639,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"The 13 kb non-segmented negative-strand (NS) HMPV RNA genome encodes nine proteins. Following virus entry, N-RNA is released into the host-cell cytoplasm and serves as template for the viral polymerase to produce sub-genomic capped and polyadenylated viral mRNAs, and for genome replication through an anti-genome intermediate. A cap 1 structure is formed at the 5’ end of viral mRNAs by the capping and MTase domains of L. Structures are available for segmented NS virus polymerases such as influenza, which acquire a capped primer by “cap snatching”. For polymerases of the Mononegavirales order, which includes several major human pathogens, the structure of the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L protein was determined first and a crystal structure of the MTase domain of HMPV-L was reported."
1640,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"Co-expressing the L and P proteins (Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1a) from HMPV in Sf9 insect cells yielded a stoichiometric preparation suitable for functional and structural studies (Fig. 1c–e). A primer elongation assay demonstrated that LWT:P complexes had polymerase activity (Fig. 1c). LWT:P complexes were also tested for de novo RNA synthesis activity using a template consisting of a sequence from the 3’ end of the HMPV genome (“le14”). The major band detected in reactions containing LWT:P, all four NTPs and radiolabeled UTP as a tracer was 12 nt in length, consistent with position 3C being the dominant initiation site (Fig. 1d). This product was not detectable in a reaction mix containing only radiolabeled UTP and no other NTPs, or in a reaction containing a chain terminator, confirming that it was the product of de novo initiation at the promoter. LD745A:P, in which Asp745 from the conserved “GDNQ” motif C was mutated to Ala, was devoid of polymerase activity, ruling out the possibility that a contaminating polymerase was responsible for the observed activity. Thus, recombinant L:P is active for RNA polymerization (Fig. 1c–d and Extended Data Fig. 2)."
1641,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"We determined the structure of the L:P complex to a resolution of 3.7 Å using cryo-EM (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Video 1, Extended Data Fig. 1). The final 3D reconstruction (Extended Data Fig. 3) allowed us to build an atomic model for residues 8 to 1380 of L and for the bound P tetramer (Fig. 1f–g, Extended Data Fig. 3–5). Residues 1381 to the C-terminus are not visible, suggesting flexibility of the peripheral appendage comprising CR-VI+. A comparison of HMPV-L with VSV-L3 returns an r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å, illustrating the preservation of the core L structure during Mononegavirales evolution (Supplementary Fig. 2). This similarity extends to the N-terminal subdomain (NTD) of VSV-L, which is essential for viral transcription (Extended Data Fig. 6). The RdRp folds into the canonical fingers-palm-thumb subdomains observed in many RNA polymerase structures (Fig. 2a). Nucleoside inhibitors have been developed targeting RSV and HMPV RdRp activity. The 5’ triphosphate metabolites of ALS-8176/ALS8112 inhibit HMPV and RSV in non-human primates with similar potency and resistant RSV mutants were sequenced. We mapped the locations of RSV-L resistance mutations to helix α29 of the present HMPV-L structure (Extended Data Fig. 7)."
1642,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"As in VSV-L, the capping domain of HMPV-L (Fig. 2b), containing the “HR” catalytic motif has a large interface with the RdRp, accounting for the rigidity of the “doughnut”. Arg1264 is exposed to the solvent, due to the mobility of the C-terminal appendage. A feature shared by RdRps that do not need a polynucleotide primer to initiate polymerization, is a “priming loop” (Fig. 2c, d) that supports the initiating rNTP. In the influenza polymerase, a proline at the tip of a β-hairpin of PB1 plays a key role for replication initiation. In rhabdoviruses (VSV and rabies virus), the corresponding loop is in the capping domain and contains residues important both for terminal de novo initiation and for mRNA capping, with a Trp residue in the capping domain essential for de novo initiation, indicating it is the priming residue. In sequence alignments, a Tyr residue lies at a similar position in HMPV-L (Tyr1201) and RSV-L (Tyr1276), which could provide base-stacking interactions required for priming (Supplementary Fig. 2). We tested this possibility using the RSV polymerase, which initiates at positions 1 and 3 on its promoter. A Tyr1276Ala substitution did not hamper RSV initiation from either site, but Ala substitution of either Pro1261 or Trp1262, corresponding to Pro1186 and Trp1187 in HMPV-L in motif B’ of the capping domain (Fig. 2c), inhibited an early stage of RNA synthesis within the promoter region (Fig. 2e, f), suggesting that either this Pro or Trp residue might be responsible for priming de novo RNA synthesis. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the N-terminal region of the loop plays a structural role not directly related to HMPV de novo initiation."
1643,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"In VSV-L, the priming loop largely occludes the central RNA binding cavity (Fig. 2d), precluding the formation of a long dsRNA duplex and indicating a pre-initiation conformation. The putative priming loop in our structure of HMPV-L retracts completely into a cavity in the capping domain, leaving ample space for several base-pairs of a primer-template dsRNA intermediate (Fig. 2b, d). Modeling an elongation complex in the HMPV L tunnel shows that an RNA duplex can indeed be accommodated in the central cavity (Fig. 3a–d)."
1644,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"In the preinitiation state of VSV-L, the connector domain (CD) and MTase domain have a defined orientation with respect to the core, being locked in place by the addition of peptide 35–106 from the VSV-P protein. In HMPV-L, one linker region located approximately at residues 1381–1407 just upstream of the CD and another at residues 1596–1598 before the CR-VI+ domain (Fig. 1a), likely account for their flexibility. Mobility of the C-terminal domain, which has nucleoside 5’-triphosphatase, nucleoside-2’-O- and guanine-N MTase activities, might be necessary to approach the 5’ end of nascent mRNA for cap addition. Thus, it is possible that N-terminal residues of HMPV-P (which are disordered here) are a latch that keeps the appendage in a fixed orientation for initiation and releases it during RNA elongation."
1645,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"Clear density corresponding to a coiled coil of four helices that constitute the P oligomerization region allowed tracing of residues 169–266 and 171–236 for the two proximal P subunits P1 and P2 in close contact with L, and of residues 168–219 and 169–231 for the two distal P subunits P3 and P4 (Fig. 1f, g and Fig. 4a). Much of P appears to fold upon binding to L, as shown by the presence of several extended arms typical of large molecular assemblies such as ribosomes or viral particles (Fig. 1, Fig. 4b and Supplementary Video 2). A large molecular surface area (Extended Data Fig. 4) becomes buried in the interaction, mostly involving residues from P1 and P2, while P3 and P4 provide few interactions (Fig. 4a). Previous structural studies mapped the tetramerization and L-binding regions of P to the four parallel α-helices (spanning residues 171–193 of P) that could be visualized using X-ray crystallography. In contrast, the N-terminal M2–1 binding regions of P, and the C-terminal regions of P that bind to the RNP were found to be “intrinsically disordered” in the absence of their respective binding partners. While the tetramerization region of P appears as a rigid unit largely unaltered upon binding L, a disorder-to-order transition in the C-terminal regions of the two subunits proximal to L takes place upon binding: residues 194 to 213 of P1 fold into a β-hairpin, such that a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is formed with residues 383–391 of the fingers subdomain of L (Fig. 4c). This β-hairpin is followed by a long tentacle-like structure composed of three consecutive α-helices that encircle the rear aperture, through which rNTPs gain access to the active site chamber (Fig. 3a). Residues at the C-terminus of the adjacent coiled-coil-forming helix (from P2) project in the opposite direction towards the capping domain (Fig. 4d) with residues 199–205 and 207–213 making two short α-helices and 215–236 forming an extended helical arm (Fig. 4a, d). Only residues Glu181 and Lys182 from P3 make contact with Lys422 and Leu424 from the finger subdomain of L and a single contact is seen between L and P4 (Fig. 4d). Finally, the helix-forming residues 215–236 of P2, together with two long and mobile helices- presumably belonging to residues 201–217 and 205–231 of P3 and P4 respectively form a three-helix bundle largely exposed to solvent. In agreement with the present observations, earlier studies suggested that residues downstream of the coiled-coil region tend to form helices and constitute a “molecular recognition element”."
1646,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"Phosphorylation by cellular kinases regulates the transcription modulation activity of VSV-P. Analysis of recombinant HMPV-P using tandem mass-spectrometry (Extended Data Fig. 8) showed that P residues targeted by phosphorylation are largely solvent-exposed and changes in phosphorylation should only affect contacts of P with the RNP and M2–1 protein, not complex formation with L (Fig. 4a)."
1647,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"In the Mononegavirales, the genome forms a helical nucleocapsid, with RNA bound in a crevice between the two N proteins subdomains. P acts as a chaperone by preventing non-specific aggregation of the N protein in the presence of non-viral RNA, preserving a pool of monomeric RNA-free N protein (N0) for RNP assembly. The P-N0 interaction involves an α-helix from HMPV-P (residues 12–28) that inserts into a hydrophobic groove in the CTD of the N0 protein. Here the entire regions N-terminal to the coiled coil of the four P subunits, including the N-terminal α-helix (PNTD), are disordered. The tetrameric coiled-coil appears to be anchored to the L protein at a location such that these helices, at the tips of flexible polar linkers spanning residues 29–135, can bind and deliver N0 to the RNA exit tunnel for encapsidating nascent RNA (Fig. 4e). The amino-acid sequence 29–135 of P (Extended Data Fig. 9) bears physico-chemical properties expected of a linker that evolved to ensure the spatial search of nascent RNA exiting L, by N0 bound to PNTD. In the present structure, the C-terminal regions of P are in non-equivalent positions (Fig. 1f, g). These segments have been proposed to dislodge RNA from the RNP complex and feed it into the template tunnel (Fig. 4e). Their structural asymmetry probably reflects different roles for the C-terminal domains of each subunit: while the C-terminal end of subunit P2 approaches the RNA template entry tunnel (Fig. 3c) and is well placed to bind N-RNA, the corresponding end of P1 is too distant to play a similar role (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the N-terminus of L (residues 8–24) wraps around the template entry tunnel (Fig. 3c). Thus, in addition to the C-terminal helix of P2, the NTD of L could help displace N to allow naked RNA to feed into the template tunnel (Fig. 3c). In summary, the tetrameric phosphoprotein binds to the monomeric L and fulfills its various adaptor functions by adopting an asymmetric structure (Fig. 4e) through (i) “conformational switching”, whereby each of the four P subunits folds into a different structure, depending on its position in the molecular assembly (ii) spatially confining structurally important N- and C-terminal helical elements (PNTD and PCTD) to the free and RNA-bound N protein respectively, through long flexible regions tethered to the rigidly anchored coiled-coil (Fig. 4e)."
1648,PMC6949429,INTRO,paragraph,"While this manuscript was under revision, the structure of RSV L:P was reported. RSV and HMPV L and P proteins have only 48% and 36% overall amino acid identity respectively, but the structures are similar (r.m.s.d. of 1.34 Å over 1501 residues). Moreover, the putative RSV-L priming loop retracts to a similar position as seen here for HMPV-L. In RSV, hydrophobic residues critical for L: P interactions (L216, L223 and L227 of RSV-P) have been shown to be critical for polymerase function. The corresponding region, residues 251–265, of subunit P1 of the HMPV phosphoprotein contains several residues that contact L (Fig. 4c). The overall conservation of interactions between L and P within the family Pneumoviridae, suggests the possibility of broad-spectrum inhibitors disrupting the L: P interface. We note that dimeric P proteins from rabies virus that interact with the C-terminal region of L clearly differ from tetrameric P proteins as for HMPV, that bind to the N-terminal part of L. Whether the mode of interactions between L and P observed here for HMPV and for RSV, is also found in more distant Mononegavirales viral families such as the Filoviridae must await further structural studies."

Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 50,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was incubated with 3 mL pre-equilibrated nickel-NTA beads (Thermo Fisher) per liter of cell pellet for 2 hours at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min at 4 °C. The pelleted beads were subjected to washes at 15 mM, 25 mM and 50 mM imidazole with 40, 30 and 20 bed volumes, respectively. Washed beads were transferred into a gravity flow column for elution. HMPV L:P complex was eluted in HMPV L:P His-trap elution buffer containing 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, through gravity flow at 4 °C. Eluted fractions were analyzed using SDS PAGE and stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon) to visualize the HMPV L and P proteins (Extended data Fig. 1a). Fractions containing the HMPV L:P complex were pooled with the addition of 1/10 (mg/ml) of TEV and subjected to dialysis against HMPV L:P lysis buffer with no imidazole at 4 °C overnight. Cleaved HMPV L:P protein was incubated with 1 mL nickel-NTA beads at 4 °C for 1 h. Flow-through and wash fractions containing L:P were pooled and subjected to heparin chromatography: a 5 mL HiTrap Heparin (GE healthcare) column was equilibrated with 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP and protein sample was loaded, washed with the same buffer, and eluted using a buffer containing 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 M NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP.

Fractions collected were subjected to SDS PAGE and instant blue staining. Fractions containing L:P complex were pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin15R with a 100 kDa cutoff concentrator (Sartorius) to a concentration of 0.85 mg/mL for cryo-EM. The final yield for the L:P complex used for cryo EM was 0.045 mg/L. During the heparin chromatographic step, a large excess of P was observed to flow through the heparin column. This fraction was further purified by size exclusion using a superdex 200 10/300 column (GE healthcare) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Na Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP and the pure P was finally concentrated in a Vivaspin15R concentrator (10 kDa cut-off). The yield of free P was 0.23 mg/L. In order to obtain protein for the polymerization assay, both the wild-type L:P and LD745A:P mutant were purified following the same procedure, but without the heparin chromatographic step.

To vitrify the sample, we applied 3.5 μL of the HMPV L:P complex (both diluted to 0.8 mg/mL) to each grid, and plunge-froze in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI) after a 4.0-second blotting (offset -2) with filter papers pre-saturated for 15 minutes under 100 % humidity. We screened the sample homogeneity and cryo preparation in an Oxford-style CT3500 cryo-specimen holder (Gatan Inc, Pleasanton, CA) on a liquid nitrogen cooling Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI, Lausanne, Switzerland), operated at 200 kV and equipped with a K2 summit direct detector (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA). We screened for thin and clean ice with maximum distribution of non-overlapping protein particles. Sample homogeneity was judged by visual observation and by 2D classification (Extended data Fig. 1).

The calibrated physical pixel size was 1.24 Å corresponding to a calibrated magnification of 40,323× on the camera sensor plane. We confirmed beam parallelization by collecting a few movies on carbon after comma-free and objective astigmatism alignments and prior to the actual data collection; the Thon rings of carbon images consistently extended beyond 2.9–2.7 Å and were of excellent stigmation (Extended data Fig. 1). For all datasets, we recorded 40 frames/movie in super-resolution mode (0.62 Å/pixel) using a dose rate of 9.2 electrons/physical pixel/second (1.24 Å/pixel), and a total exposure of 48 electrons/Å2. We recorded a total of 7,438 and 1,100 dose-fractionated images for the L:P sample and L:P supplemented with P sample, respectively."

1663,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"We aligned the super resolution movie frames using MotionCor2 with dose filtering and 5 by 5 patched sub-frame alignment; the frames were binned over 2 by 2 super-resolution “pixels” in Fourier space, yielding the physical pixel size of 1.24 Å of the saved micrographs. We binned the motion-corrected micrographs by a factor of 4 (4.96 Å/pixel) and low-pass filtered to 15 Å for visual examination. We discarded those of thick ice, abnormal defocus, or large carbon areas. For particle picking and 2D classification, we down-sampled the micrographs to 2.48 Å/pixel in Fourier space using resample_mp.exe to facilitate computation. We manually picked particles for 10 representative micrographs using e2boxer.py and used these boxes to train the auto-picking model in crYOLO. We then used the trained model to automatically pick particles from all micrographs with the crYOLO Phosaurus network. We visually reviewed the results and manually improved the automatically picked boxes for the 10 micrographs, while incorporating missed representative micrographs for the next round training. We repeated the crYOLO training/autopicking procedures until all particles were accurately picked and well centered from all micrographs. The final L:P data contained a total of 5,381,943 particles, while that of L:P supplemented with P contained 606,410 particles."
1664,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"We determined the defocus values and defocus angles of the unbinned (1.24 Å/pixel) micrographs using ctffind4. The Thon ring fitting resolution (reported by ctffind4) of most selected micrographs consistently fell into the 2.9~3.3 Å range (Extended data Fig. 1), indicating good data quality. We performed 2D classification in Relion until all high-quality 2D class images became apparent (within 50 iterations). We only selected the best 2D classes judged by visual examination and by the resolution and other statistics reported by Relion, retaining 880,724 particles for 3D analysis."
1665,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"To speed-up computation, we started the initial 3D analysis with the data downsampled to 2.48 Å/pixel. We generated the ab initio model (3 classes) using Relion, and selected the best class as a reference model for further data analysis. We performed one round of mode 3 alignment for the 2D class images against the 3D initial model in frealign (version 9.11), with CTF correction turned off. We then calculated projection matching using frealign (version 9.11) to cross-validate the 3D model and to confirm the 2D class selection as a self-consistency test. We performed 3D classification straightly with 6 classes in Relion until convergence (within 50 iterations). Two classes were clearly of high quality and superimposed well, with a cross correlation coefficient higher than 99%. We combined these two classes, yielding a total of 437,611 particles. The handedness of the maps was confirmed to be correct as judged by well-defined α-helices. From this point on, we scaled the alignment parameters to 1.24 Å/pixel and used the full resolution data for further analysis. Relion auto-refinement of these particles produced a map of 4.0-Å resolution. We further improved the resolution to 3.9-Å after refining the per-particle motion in Relion and to 3.8 Å after beam tilt refinement by treating all particles as one group. Refining the defocus of individual particles did not yield obvious improvement. We confirmed convergence of motion correction by another round of per-particle motion refinement, which yielded no apparent improvement. Nonetheless, the quality of this map at 3.8-Å resolution was excellent, as judged by main-chain continuity and side-chain densities (Extended data Fig. 1g, h). We further classified the 437,611 particles into six classes and discarded four junk classes, yielding a total of 302,346 particles. We auto-refined the two good classes individually or combined and again they overlapped nearly perfectly. We then gave the data more weights by adjusting the T number in Relion and later performed masked alignment, while correcting FSC for effects of the solvent mask. We visually examined the results and found out that a T number of 4 produced the best map without apparent signs of over-fitting. This combined with another round of per-particle motion refinement, beam tilt refinement, and per particle defocus refinement eventually yielded a map at 3.7 Å. In an effort to improve the density associated with P, we generated masks for P and L using Chimera segger and performed multi-body refinement using Relion, with the orientation of P relative to L fixed. We also subtracted the L signal from the 2D images, excised P from the 2D images, and performed 3D classification without alignment. Neither approach improved the P density, perhaps due to insufficient signal considering the small size of P. The final map was at 3.7 Å resolution and was sharpened with a B factor value of −188.25 Å2. The procedure is summarized in Extended Data Fig. 3."
1666,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"We followed the same data processing paradigm with minor adjustments for the dataset of the L:P preparation supplemented with P. The classification results were consistent with the L:P dataset, leaving 273,574 and 65,398 particles for the good classes after 2D classification and a first round of 3D classification, respectively. The final map after a second round of 3D classification was at 4.1-Å resolution from 29,376 particles and was nearly identical to the map from the L:P dataset. Hence, we mainly used the map from the L:P dataset for map interpretation, except for two less well-defined C-terminal helices of two P subunits (P3 and P4)."
1667,PMC6949429,METHODS,title_2,Model building and refinement
1668,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"We built the atomic model using the graphics programs O and Coot. First, we fitted the RdRp and capping enzymatic domains of the VSV-L model (PDB access code: 5A22) into the map as well as the coiled-coil domain of P (PDB access code: 4BXT) and then used these as a guide for finding main-chain connectivity. Local resolution analysis indicated that the majority of the core portion of the complex falls within a resolution range of 3.0–3.6 Å, with excellent main-chain connectivity and side chain densities throughout the molecules (Extended Data Fig 1g, h). The majority of the electron density showed excellent continuity giving confidence for tracing the α–carbon chain. Moreover, in most regions, clear electron density for side chains allowed us to unambiguously assign the sequence register. We only observed weak and disordered extra density accounting for a portion of the CD and CRVI+ domains in maps sharpened with lower B factors and/or low-pass filtered with lower spatial frequency, suggesting that these domains are highly flexible in the complexes we examined. The appendage of HMPV-L might become fixed with respect to the ring-shaped core domain upon binding to a peptide encompassing residues 35–106 of the VSV-P used in the VSV-L study. Indeed, a recent study of the rabies virus L protein in complex with the counterpart of this P peptide demonstrates such contacts between P and L (Josh Horwitz and Stephen C. Harrison, personal communication). Although there were some stretches of weaker densities for the P protein, long side-chains of arginine and lysine residues ensured the correct polarity and register assignment of the sequence. We further confirmed that the sequence was in register by comparing the model with the coiled-coil interface of the known structure of the phosphoprotein tetramerization region (PDB code: 4BXT). Overall, we traced the entire NTD subdomain and RdRp domain spanning residues 8–892, except for mobile residues 1–7 (predicted to be disordered using the PrDOS prediction server http://prdos.hgc.jp/cgi-bin/top.cgi), 607–625 (603–625 are predicted to be disordered), the complete capping enzyme domain (residues 893–1380) and the four P subunits (residues 169–266, 171–236, 168–219, and 169–193/204–231 of subunits P1, P2, P3 and P4, respectively). Residues 194–203 of subunit P4 are disordered. While the sequences could be assigned unambiguously for P1 and P2 residues as well as for the coiled coil region of P3 and P4, the sequence assignment for the C-terminal ends of P3 and P4 that are predicted to form helices is less certain. These segments might become fully ordered only in the presence of the ribonucleoprotein (see main text). Model building was interspersed with refinement using the real space refinement option in the package PHENIX (rigid_body, minimization_global, local grid searching and ADP) for the coordinates and B factors. We applied Ramachandran, rotamer and secondary structure restraints throughout the refinement, in addition to the standard geometry and B factor restraints. Over 40 rounds of manual rebuilding and phenix real space refinement were carried out until we had high confidence of the sequence register, density fitting, model geometry and local chemical environments. We analyzed the final model with MolProbity and statistics are given in Extended Data Table 1. We deposited the refined coordinates to wwPDB (PDB access code: 6U5O) and the electron density map to EMDB (EMDB access code: EMD-20651)."

1674,PMC6949429,METHODS,paragraph,"We performed tandem mass spectrometry data collection and analysis (Extended Data Fig. 8) for both the purified L:P complex and free P following a standard protocol. Briefly, we digested 2 μg of each sample over night at 37°C with trypsin (1:100 enzyme:sample molar ratio). Digests were carried out in 200 mM EPPS pH 8.5 in presence of 2% acetonitrile (v/v) with trypsin (Promega #V5111). After peptide purification by reversed phase C18 chromatography 1 μg of peptides was separated with a 4-hour acetonitrile gradient by HPLC prior to injection. Data were collected using an Orbitrap Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography (LC) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The 75 μm inner diameter capillary column used was packed with C18 resin (Accucore 2.6 μm). The scan sequence started with collection of an MS spectrum (Orbitrap analysis; resolution 120,000; mass range 400–1400 Th). MS2 analysis followed collision-induced dissociation (CID, CE=35) with a maximum ion injection time of 250 ms and an isolation window of 1.2 Da. Neutral loss of phosphate was taken into account by using a multi-stage activation (MSA) method with a neutral loss of 97.9763 Da. Peptides were searched with a SEQUEST-based algorithm against an insect database containing L and P protein sequences and common contaminants in addition. Searches were performed with a target decoy database strategy and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% set for peptide-spectrum matches followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) filtering and a final collapsed protein-level FDR of 1%. We dynamically searched for oxidized methionine (+15.9949146221 Da) and phospho-serine, -threonine and -tyrosine (+79.9663304104 Da). Phosphorylation site localization used a modified Anova score (ModScore). We repeated the experiments twice and the results were consistent."

The W1262A substitution was generated by site-directed mutagenesis by Genscript, the P1261A, P1274A, Y1276A substitutions were generated using Q5 site directed mutagenesis (NEB). RSV P1261A was generated using forward primer 5′-ACCTACTAAGGCCTGGGTCGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCCTCTCGCCCCTGGTC-3′. RSV P1274A was generated using forward primer 5′-CCAGGAAAAAAAGACCATGGCCGTCTACAACAGG -3′ and reverse primer 5′- GTGGAGGAGCCGACCCAGGGCTTAGTAGG -3′. RSV Y1276A was generated using forward primer 5′-CATGCCCGTCGCCAACAGGCAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTCTTTTTTTCCTGGGTG-3′. The mutated ORF fragments were sequenced and then substituted in the codon optimized L ORF contained in a T7 expression vector (pTM1) by restriction digest and ligation. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations, and to ensure that no other changes were introduced during PCR-amplification steps. BSR-T7 cells, a BHK-derived cell line that constitutively expresses T7 polymerase (provided by Dr Karl Conzelmann), in six well dishes were transfected with pTM1 plasmids expressing the following proteins: RSV (A2 strain) N (400 ng/well), P (200 ng/well), M2–1 (100 ng/well), and L (or L mutant; 100 ng/well), and a plasmid expressing a minigenome RNA containing nt 1–36 of the trailer (tr) promoter at its 3´ end (200 ng/well). The minigenome was limited to synthesizing only the first strand of replication, by the lack of a promoter specific sequence at the 3´ end of the replicative intermediate. The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 40–48 h post transfection, cells were harvested and RNA was purified using Trizol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, except that the RNA was subjected to a further round of purification by extraction with phenol-chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation. RNA products initiated within the tr promoter were analyzed by primer extension. RNA representing one-tenth of a well of cells were subjected to reverse transcription at 37˚C using the Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen) and a radiolabeled primer (5´-TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGAC-3´). One half the primer extension reaction was subjected to electrophoresis in 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea in 1× TBE. Radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to cDNA representing initiation from positions +1 and +3 of the tr promoter were used as markers (+1, 5´-TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGACTTTTTTTCTCGT-3´; +3, 5´- TACGAGATATTAGTTTTTGAGACTTTTTTTCTC-3´´). The same RNA samples, RNA representing one-tenth of a well of cells, were also subjected to denaturing gel electrophoresis on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose by northern blotting. The input minigenome template was detected using a radiolabeled strand-specific riboprobe. Primer extension products were visualized by autoradiography and the primer extension products and input minigenome were quantified using phosphorimager analysis. The levels of input minigenome were used to normalize for transfection efficiency. The data were normalized to the mean of the two WT samples included in each experiment. With the caveat that the sample sizes were an n of 3, statistical analysis using ANOVA showed that the levels of +1 and +3 RNA products for the P1261A and W1262A L variants were significantly different than those from wt L (p values of 0.002 and 0.003, respectively for +1; 0.004 for both variants for +3), whereas the levels of RNA produced from P1274A and Y1276A L variants were not statistically different (p values of 0.0385 and 0.549, respectively for +1; 0.227 and 0.518, respectively for +3)."

When a 3’-modified le25 (le25[SpC3], three-carbon spacer group linked to the 3’ extremity) was used as a template, synthesis of products greater than 25 nt was greatly reduced compared to le25. When only [α-32P]rATP and no other rNTP was supplied, only a product with size greater than 25 nt was observed. This result shows that the L:P complex was capable of modifying the 3’ terminus of the template, in addition to engaging in de novo initiation at the promoter.

1743,PMC7125538,TITLE,front,A novel immunochromatographic system for easy-to-use detection of group 1 avian influenza viruses with acquired human-type receptor binding specificity
1744,PMC7125538,ABSTRACT,abstract,"A switch of viral hemagglutinin receptor binding specificity from bird-type α2,3- to human-type α2,6-linked sialic acid is necessary for an avian influenza virus to become a pandemic virus. In this study, an easy-to-use strip test to detect receptor binding specificity of influenza virus was developed. A biotinylated anti-hemagglutinin antibody that bound a broad range of group 1 influenza A viruses and latex-conjugated α2,3 (blue) and α2,6 (red) sialylglycopolymers were used in an immunochromatographic strip test, with avidin and lectin immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane at test and control lines, respectively. Accumulation of a sialylglycopolymer–virus–antibody complex at the test line was visualized by eye. The strip test could be completed in 30 min and did not require special equipment or skills, thereby avoiding some disadvantages of current methods for analyzing receptor binding specificity of influenza virus. The strip test could detect the receptor binding specificity of a wide range of influenza viruses, as well as small increases in the binding affinity of variant H5N1 viruses to α2,6 sialylglycans at viral titers >128 hemagglutination units. The strip test results were in agreement with those of ELISA virus binding assays, with correlations >0.95. In conclusion, the immunochromatographic strip test developed in this study should be useful for monitoring potential changes in the receptor binding specificity of group 1 influenza A viruses in the field."

1751,PMC7125538,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1752,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"Emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza, have been of increasing public concern in the past few decades. These diseases involve animal-to-human transmission of zoonotic pathogens. In particular, an influenza pandemic would be devastating and a serious threat to human health and the global economy."
1753,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"Avian influenza (AI) viruses were the origin of the influenza A viruses and also have been involved in the emergence of all past influenza pandemics. Therefore, surveillance of AI viruses to assess their evolution in the field is crucial for preparing for an influenza pandemic."
1754,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"Influenza viruses are classified into subtypes based on the antigenic properties of their two surface glycoproteins: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). To date, 18 HA subtypes and 11 NA subtypes have been identified. Almost all possible combinations of HA and NA subtypes have been detected in influenza viruses isolated from aquatic birds, poultry and other bird species. The 18 HA subtypes are phylogenetically categorized into group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17 and H18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14 and H15) HAs, with HAs in the same group antigenically related, although they can be distinguished by subtype-specific antibodies."
1755,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"HA is the main determinant of viral infectivity and consists of a head region and a stalk region. Influenza viruses attach to host cells by specific binding between the HA head region and sialylglycan that is expressed on the host cell surface. Influenza viruses also recognize terminal sialic acid (Sia) and galactose linkage patterns on sialylglycans. Human influenza viruses preferentially bind to α2,6-linked Sia (α2,6 Sia), whereas most avian viruses preferentially bind to a sugar chain ending in α2,3-linked Sia (α2,3 Sia). This plays a key role of the interspecies barrier that prevents AI viruses from easily infecting humans. Therefore, it is believed that a switch of HA receptor specificity from α2,3 Sia to α2,6 Sia is essential for the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus."
1756,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"The highly pathogenic AI virus subtype H5N1 (H5N1 virus) that emerged in China around 1997 has become endemic in birds in some areas, including China, Viet Nam, Indonesia and Egypt (. H5N1 virus can be directly transmitted from birds to humans and cause a severe respiratory disease with high morbidity (60%). Fortunately, all human H5N1 infections have been restricted to people with close contact with infected poultry and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission. However, repeated bird-to-human transmission may allow H5N1 viruses to acquire HA mutations that change their receptor specificity from α2,3 Sia (bird-type) to α2,6 Sia (human-type), thereby generating a pandemic virus. H5N1 virus has now diverged genetically to form 10 phylogenetically and phenotypically distinct clades (designated clades 0–9) in different geographic areas. Such complex ecology and diversification in the field increase the pandemic potential of H5N1 virus. In addition, other subtype AI viruses, such as H9N2 and H7N9, have also been directly transmitted to humans."
1757,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"Thus far, human-adaptive changes in AI viruses had been thought to occur during AI virus infections in humans and/or pigs. However, recent studies showed that AI virus could acquire increased human-type receptor binding affinity during viral transmission and infection in birds. These results highlight the importance of monitoring possible changes in AI receptor binding specificity in the field to enable rapid response to the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus."
1758,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"Several assay techniques have been developed to analyze receptor binding affinity of influenza virus. The solid-phase virus binding assay is a quantitative system that can detect small changes in receptor binding affinity of influenza virus. Glycan microarrays enable multiplex analysis using a panel of glycans with different topologies. A new assay system has been developed combining a virus binding assay and real-time RT-PCR. However, these very sensitive assay systems require a high level of technical expertise, expensive reagents and specialized equipment."
1759,PMC7125538,INTRO,paragraph,"These limitations indicate the need for a system that is easier to use for detecting changes in influenza virus binding specificity. Immunochromatographic assays based on specific antigen–antibody reactions are very useful diagnostic tools and do not require specialized equipment or complicated handling procedures. Despite their relatively moderate sensitivity, immunochromatographic assays have been used in various rapid diagnostic kits to detect virus infections for clinical diagnosis and surveillance, since they are fairly simple and rapid. In this study, we developed a new easy-to-use immunochoromatographic strip test to detect the emergence of AI viruses with increased human-type receptor specificity and confirmed the applicability of this test using AI viruses isolated in several different geographic areas."

A 1 µg/ml solution of each sialylglycopolymer (non-conjugated with colored latex) was prepared in PBS, and 100 µl of this solution was added to each well of 96-well microtiter plates (Polystyrene Universal-Bind Microplates, Corning, USA). The plates were then irradiated with 254 nm ultraviolet light for 10 min, and each well was washed three times with 250 µl PBS. Each well was blocked with 200 µl SuperBlock Blocking Buffer (Thermo Scientific, USA) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST), a serial dilution of 256 HAU of an influenza virus in PBST was added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 12 h. After five washes with ice-cold PBST, monoclonal antibody against influenza virus nucleoprotein, which is a structural protein of the viral particle, was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The wells were then washed five times with ice-cold PBST and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-immunoglobulin (Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO, Nichirei, Japan) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing five times with ice-cold PBST, 100 µl SureBlue Reserve Peroxidase Substrate (KPL, USA) was added to each well and, after incubation at room temperature for 10 min, absorbance at 630 nm (developed blue color) was measured."

The expansion solution was a mixture of surfactant agents: 0.2% Triton X-405, 1% Tween 20, and 50 μg DANA (N-acetyl-2.3-didehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid)/ml in Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5). These surfactant concentrations were sufficient to inactivate influenza virus infectivity and sialidase activity. The antibody solution contained 0.12 mg biotinylated anti-HA antibody C179/ml. C179 is a monoclonal antibody against the antigenically conserved HA stem region, and has been reported to bind to a broad range of group 1 influenza HAs (H1, H2, H5, H6 and H9). A preliminary study showed that C179 reacted with all of the group 1 influenza HAs in this study, while monoclonal antibodies against the antigenically variable HA head region only reacted with some of these HAs (Table S1). C179 binding to the HA stem region has been reported to not interfere with the interaction between sialylglycans and the HA head region, which enabled its use in the strip test to detect sialylglycan–HA complexes."

A virus sample and biotinylated anti-HA antibody C179 were mixed and incubated for 15 min. The mixture was then applied on the sample pad. During migration though the sialylglycopolymer pad, virus–C179 antibody complexes formed a colored sialylglycopolymer–virus–biotinylated antibody complex, which was captured by avidin at the test line. Accumulation of the trimetric complex produced a visible test line with the color of the bound sialylglycopolymer (α2,3 Sia, blue; α2,6 Sia, red). Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured by lectin at the control line. The strip test was completed 15 min after the virus–antibody complex was applied on the sample pad.

1772,PMC7125538,METHODS,paragraph,"Each test strip consisted of four components assembled on a plastic backing: a sample pad, a sialylglycopolymer pad, a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane and an absorption pad ( Fig. 1A). The three pads were as follows: the sample pads were Rayon Nonwoven Fabric (Advantec), each 4 mm wide, 2 cm long and 0.24 mm thick; the sialylglycopolymer pads were glass fiber (Millipore Corporation), each 4 mm wide, 8 mm long and 0.43 mm thick; and the absorption pads were filter paper (Advantec), each 4 mm wide, 3.4 cm long and 1.35 mm thick. The NC membranes (Millipore Corporation) were 4 mm wide and 3 cm long, and the plastic backings were adhesive backing cards (Lohmann Technologies Corp.), each 4 mm wide and 7.6 cm long. A sialylglycopolymer pad was prepared by spraying it with either blue latex-conjugated α2,3 sialylglycopolymer or red latex-conjugated α2,6 sialylglycopolymer (denoted as an α2,3 Sia strip and an α2,6 Sia strip, respectively) and drying at room temperature. Our previous study showed that the latex-conjugated sialylglycopolymers are remarkably stable without any aggregation even in boiling water. An 0.4 μl sample of a 4 mg avidin/ml solution and a 0.4 μl sample of a 1 mg lectin/ml solution were dispensed on each NC membrane to form test and control lines, respectively, and the membrane was air-dried. The distance between test and control lines was about 7 mm."
1773,PMC7125538,METHODS,paragraph,"To assemble a test strip, an NC membrane was pasted onto the center of the plastic backing (using acrylic adhesive) and covered with the sialylglycopolymer pad at one end and the absorption pad at the other end. A sample pad was pasted onto the plastic backing at the top of the sialylglycopolymer pad. The NC membranes with attached pads were then cut into 4 mm wide test strips and stored desiccated at 4 °C."

1775,PMC7125538,METHODS,paragraph,"Virus samples (30 µl) were mixed with 90 µl of expansion solution and 30 µl of antibody solution, and then incubated for 15 min to form virus–C179 complexes (Fig. 1A). Each mixture was then pipetted onto a test strip sample pad or, alternatively, a sample pad was immersed in the virus mixture. This allowed the mixture to migrate along the strip by capillary action. During migration through the sialylglycopolymer pad, the virus–C179 complex was able to form a complex with α2,3 Sia or α2,6 Sia depending on the virus HA receptor binding affinity. Principle of the subsequent reaction is mainly based on two types of interaction: avidin–biotin interaction and lectin–glycan interaction. As the virus–C179–sialylglycopolymer complex migrated along the test strip, it was captured at the test line by avidin–biotinylated C179 interaction. Accumulation of the trimeric complex resulted in visual blue and red test lines on the α2,3 Sia strips and α2,6 Sia strips, respectively. If a viral HA did not bind either sialyglycopolymer, there was no visible test line because the captured virus–C179 dimeric complex was colorless. Excess complexes and free sialylglycopolymers were captured at the control line by lectin–glycan interactions, resulting in visible blue and red control lines on the α2,3 Sia strips and α2,6 Sia strips, respectively."
1776,PMC7125538,METHODS,paragraph,"The results of this assay were observed by eye 15 min after deposition of the virus mixture onto the strips. The presence of double blue lines on the α2,3 Sia strip and double red lines on the α2,6 Sia strip indicated virus binding affinity to α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia, respectively. Only a blue control line on the α2,3 Sia strip and only a red control line on the α2,6 Sia strip indicated no binding affinity to α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia respectively, or that the amount of virus was below the limit of detection of this assay. If a control line did not appear within 15 min, the test was considered invalid. Thus, the complete assay took only 30 min."

1778,PMC7125538,METHODS,paragraph,"In past influenza pandemics, mutant viruses with dual tropism for both α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia have emerged in the immediate early phase of an outbreak. These prototype viruses subsequently switched their receptor binding specificity from bird-type to human-type sialyglycans to become established pandemic viruses. Therefore, based on the patterns of the test lines on the α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia strips (Fig. 1B), viral receptor binding specificity was identified as follows: (i) only a blue test line indicated typical bird-type receptor specificity; (ii) both blue and red test lines indicated increased human-type receptor affinity with residual bird-type receptor affinity, denoting an interphyletic mutant virus; and (iii) only a red test line alone indicated a switch of viral receptor affinity from bird-type to human-type receptors, denoting either a novel virus with a high pandemic potential or a pandemic virus."

1783,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"For this study, the receptor binding specificity of several virus strains that were used as reference viruses were confirmed by virus binding assays. The reference viruses were as follows: A/Suita/117/2011 (Suita/117), a human H1N1 strain; A/Japan/434/2003 (Japan/434), a human H3N2 strain; EG/D1 and recombinant rEG/D1 virus, bird H5N1 strains; and rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D128Δ/I151T, mutant rEG/D1 viruses with enhanced human-type receptor specificity. Previous studies reported that HA Q192H and 128Δ/I151T mutations increased viral binding affinity for α2,6 Sia. Therefore, rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D1128Δ/I151T were generated by introducing the Q192H and 128Δ/I151T mutations into EG/D1 HA to produce representative interphyletic viruses for this study. The virus binding assays showed that Suita/117 and Japan/434 had binding specificity for α2,6 Sia ( Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, EG/D1 and rEG/D1 had binding specificity for α2,3 Sia (Fig. 2C and D). Interphyletic viruses rEG/D1Q192H and rEG/D1128Δ/I151T had significantly increased binding to α2,6 Sia, with binding to both α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia (Fig. 2E and F). The binding curves of these viruses were typical Sia binding specificity profiles for human viruses, bird viruses, and interphyletic viruses, respectively."

1785,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the strip test by investigating the reactivity of 8–512 HAU of the reference viruses to α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia. Suita/117 gave clear red test lines on α2,6 Sia strips for virus titers of 32–512 HAU ( Fig. 3A). However, even at the highest titer, 512 HAU, Suita/117 produced no visible blue test line on the α2,3 Sia strip, indicating human-type receptor specificity. Japan/434, which is classified as a group 2 influenza A virus, produced no visible test lines on either α2,6 Sia or α2,3 Sia strips (Fig. 3B). These results showed that the visible test lines produced on the test strips were the result of specific C179 binding to group 1 influenza HAs."
1786,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"In contrast, EG/D1 gave clear blue test lines on α2,3 Sia test strips when the virus titer was 32–512 HAU (Fig. 3C). However, even the highest EG/D1 titer, 512 HAU, produced no visible red test line on α2,6 Sia strips, showing bird-type receptor specificity. To further assess the receptor specificity of H5N1 viruses that were circulating in geographical areas other than Egypt, we tested A/chicken/Soc Trang/5/2013 and A/tree sparrow/Indonesia/D10013/2010, which were typical bird-type H5N1 viruses isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia, respectively. These two viruses produced blue test lines only on α2,3 Sia strips, with the same sensitivity (Fig. 3D and E). These results showed that the test strips consistently detected the receptor binding specificity of group 1 influenza viruses."
1787,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"The reactivity of the test strips to the interphyletic viruses with titers of 32–256 HAU was then evaluated.

In addition, 128–256 HAU of these viruses produced visible red test lines on α2,6 Sia strips, in contrast to the results with the parental rEG/D1 virus (Fig. 3F). These results showed that the test strips were able to detect human-type receptor binding by interphyletic viruses at higher titers (>128 HAU).

1790,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,A long-term storage test was then performed to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of the strip test.

1792,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"To verify the potential applicability of the test strip, the HA receptor specificity of 63 influenza virus strains that had been isolated in the several geographical areas were examined. The results showed that 4 strains that were classified as Egyptian clade 2.2.1 sublineage A/B viruses had dual binding affinity to both α2,3 Sia and α2,6 Sia, indicating that they were interphyletic viruses ( Fig. 5 and Table 1). This was in agreement with the previous report that sublineage A/B viruses have generally acquired an increased human-type receptor binding affinity. In contrast, all the H5N1 strains that were isolated in Viet Nam and Indonesia showed typical bird-type receptor specificity. Several variant-type strains with increased α2,6 Sia binding affinity have been reported in some Asian countries. However, acquisition of human-type receptor affinity by Asian H5N1 viruses seemed to be strain-specific, which may explain why the Asian H5N1 viruses tested in this study did not show dual receptor specificity. Further evaluation of the test strips using larger numbers of Asian H5N1 strains may detect interphyletic viruses in these areas."
1793,PMC7125538,RESULTS,paragraph,"In this study, two H5N1 virus strains produced no visible test lines on either α2,3 Sia or α2,6 Sia test strips (Table 1), even though the titers of these viruses were >128 HAU. Epidemiological studies have reported a few exceptional virus strains that recognized distinct sialylglycan topologies. Thus, these two viruses may have such an exceptional receptor binding specificity. However, these viruses may not have bound the C179 antibody due to amino acid change(s) at the antigen epitope in the HA stem region. Further genetic analyses and characterization of these two viruses are needed to elucidate the reason(s) why these viruses did not produce bands on the test strips."
1794,PMC7125538,CONCL,title_1,Conclusions
1795,PMC7125538,CONCL,paragraph,"The results described above demonstrated the utility of the test strip system developed in this study to analyze the receptor specificity of influenza viruses. Compared with conventional methods to analyze receptor binding affinity of influenza virus, the test strip system was simple and easy to use: only a drop of virus and the test strips were required, without any additional methods or equipment. The test strips were shown to be applicable to a broad range of group 1 influenza A vruses and allowed semi-quantitative detection of their receptor binding affinities. These results indicate that the test strips could be applied as a screening device to monitor possible evolutionary changes in AI receptor binding specificity in the field."
1796,PMC7125538,CONCL,paragraph,"The sensitivity of the test strips was not adequate for rapid diagnosis of clinical samples (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs). However, traditional methods for determining viral genome sequences, pathogenicity and drug resistance using isolated viruses are still routinely used in public health and academic laboratories worldwide. Since isolated virus samples contain significantly more virus than clinical samples, application of the strip test to influenza virus analysis should enable us to more easily and comprehensively monitor AI evolution and pandemic potential in the field. The strip test system described here could then be applied for rapid diagnosis in the field when its sensitivity is improved."

1808,PMC7394220,TITLE,front,Mixed Lineage Leukemia 1 Promoted Neuron Apoptosis in Ischemic Penumbra via Regulating ASK-1/TNF-α Complex
1809,PMC7394220,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra was proved to be involved in ischemic stroke (IS) development and contributed to the poor prognosis of IS. Recent studies showed that aberrant trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) level was associated with cell apoptosis. This study aimed to explore the underlying mechanism of neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra via histone methyltransferase (HMT) mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) mediated epigenetic pathway. Mouse IS model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mouse primary cortical mixed cells were cultured and treated with oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) to simulate IS process. The expressions of apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1 (ASK-1), pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/serine–threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP)/14-3-3 complex, ASK-1/tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) complex, and MLL1 in mouse brain tissue and mouse primary cortical mixed cells were analyzed. The function of MLL1 was investigated using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting MLL1 and vector overexpressing MLL1. In vivo inhibition of MLL1 was conducted to explore its value as a therapeutic target. The prognostic value of MLL1 was investigated in IS patients. Results showed that the expressions of ASK-1, pASK-1, cleaved caspase-3, ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra compared to brain tissue from the control group (P < 0.05). MCAO and OGD significantly upregulated the H3K4me3 level in ASK-1 promoter region and promoted the recruitment of MLL1 to this region (P < 0.05). siMLL1 significantly reversed the proapoptosis effects of OGD in primary cortical mixed cells, while MLL1 overexpression induced apoptosis of cells (P < 0.05). In vivo inhibition of MLL1 significantly reduced the infarct volume and the neurological score of MCAO mice (P < 0.05). Serum MLL1 level had a positive association with that in ischemic core and penumbra in mouse model and was positively correlated with the infarct volume and neurological score (P < 0.05). Besides, serum MLL1 level was also significantly correlated with the severity of IS (P < 0.05), and high serum MLL1 level indicated poor prognosis of IS patients (P < 0.05). These results revealed that MLL1 contributed to neuron cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbra after IS onset by promoting the formation of ASK-1/TNF-α complex, and its serum level was associated with poor prognosis of IS."
1810,PMC7394220,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1811,PMC7394220,INTRO,paragraph,"Ischemic stroke (IS) is the most common type of stroke, accounting for ~80% of all strokes (Adeoye et al.,). The global mortality rate of IS is 10–40%, the recurrence rate of survivors is about 40%, and the disability rate is more than 50% (Guzik and Bushnell,; Adeoye et al.,). Apoptosis of neuron cells in ischemic penumbra contributes a significant proportion to the development of acute brain ischemia, but the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood (Radak et al.,)."
1812,PMC7394220,INTRO,paragraph,"Apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1) is a component of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis complex I, and its activation (phosphorylation) is required for TNF-α-induced apoptosis in multiple cell types (Hatai et al.,; Han et al.,). To prevent TNF-α-induced apoptosis, serine–threonine kinase receptor-associated protein (STRAP) and 14-3-3 proteins interact with ASK-1 to disrupt associations between TNF receptor-associated factor 2 and ASK-1 upon TNF-α stimulation (Hatai et al.,; Han et al.,). In recent years, the aberrant histone methylation was suggested to be associated with neuron cell apoptosis (Zhoa et al.,; Yung et al.,). Histone methylation can promote or inhibit the transcription of methylation sites, and lysine (K) methylation of histone is a research hotspot in recent years (Alam et al.,; Kim et al.,). As an active histone modification, the trimethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me3) can be recognized by specific proteins and further recruit downstream coregulatory components, thus promoting the transcription and expression of the target genes (Bochyńska et al.,). Mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) is the main histone methyltransferase (HMT) responsible for the catalysis of H3K4me3 (Yang and Ernst,), whose abnormal expression had been proven to be tightly associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis (Wang et al.,; Sengupta et al.,)."
1813,PMC7394220,INTRO,paragraph,"Based on the above background, we suggested a hypothesis that MLL1 was involved in neuron cell apoptosis in ischemic penumbra by regulating ASK-1-related apoptosis complexes. We explored the function and mechanism of MLL1 using mouse IS model and mouse primary cortical mixed cells. We also conducted a case–control study to explore the prognostic value of MLL1 in IS, thus providing a new approach to improve the prognosis of IS."

1820,PMC7394220,METHODS,paragraph,"Mice were randomly divided into the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group and the control group. Mice from the MCAO group were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and fixed. The origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was blocked by silicon-coated mono-filament nylon suture. The MCAO model was proved to be successful by the reduction in semicerebral blood flow shown by B-ultrasound detection. For mice from the control group, the same surgical procedure was performed except for the suture ligation of MCA. After the surgery, carprofen (5 mg/kg, three times a day) was given by subcutaneous injection for analgesia for 3 days. At 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after modeling, 40 μl tail vein blood of each mouse was collected. Then, mice were euthanized. Brain tissues were quickly removed and sliced into sections of 2-mm thickness. The slices were stained with 0.5% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (Sh-haling Biotechnology, China) to show the infarct lesion (pale area). Infarct volume (%) = V (infarct area)/V (homolateral hemisphere) × 100%."
1821,PMC7394220,METHODS,paragraph,"Neurological deficit score was assessed as previously described (Rogers et al.,) at 24 h after MCAO: (0) no neurological symptoms; (1) failure to extend right paw completely; (2) the strength of the right forelimb is noticeably reduced; (3) rotating and crawling towards the right side; and (4) unable to walk spontaneously. During the assessment, staffs were blind to the group information of each mouse."
1822,PMC7394220,METHODS,paragraph,"According to the prior report (Ashwal et al.,), the middle coronal brain section was used for determining the ischemic penumbra.

1871,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
1872,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In the present study, we found that MLL1 was upregulated in the ischemic penumbra and OGD-treated primary cortical mixed cells, and its expression level in ischemic penumbra was positively correlated with its serum level and also positively correlated with the severity of IS. In vitro study revealed that OGD promoted the recruitment of MLL1 to the promoter region of ASK-1 and enhanced the activation of ASK-1/TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. In addition, our study also suggested that high MLL1 levels in the serum indicated higher mortality and a poorer functional outcome of IS patients within 24 months."
1873,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Concerning the potential mechanism of IS development, it is still not fully clarified. IS can be caused by brain ischemia. The blockage of a brain artery accounts for ~80% of the IS cases (Adeoye et al.,). In the process of IS development, the cerebral tissue has two important and independent areas: the core of the infarct and the ischemic penumbra. The core of the infarct is defined as the severe hypoperfusion area where neurons directly affected by the lack of glucose and oxygen, and eventually die by necrosis, while the ischemic penumbra is the less hypoperfused area surrounding the core, where neuronal cells are still metabolically active within a certain period and—depending on circumstances—will either die or survive (Berta et al.,). Cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra may occur in hours or days, and this process is multifactorial and complex (Radak et al.,). Presently, local recanalization and systemic thrombolysis are the only therapeutic options to treat IS, with a short therapeutic window for 4.5 h after stroke onset, and only 20% of patients benefit from this treatment (Chamorro et al.,). Finding mechanisms of neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra is a key way to improve the prognosis of IS patients."
1874,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Recently, aberrant epigenetic histone modification was found to be involved in neuron apoptosis. As an active histone modification, the H3K4me3 level had been proven to be upregulated in the promoter region of some specific genes during the neuronal apoptotic process (Yung et al.,). MLL1 is the main HMT that catalyzes the methylation of H3K4 site (Yang and Ernst,). MLL1 had drawn people’s attention because of its function in the development of mixed lineage leukemia (Cao et al.,). However, concerning MLL1 and IS, the related document is extremely limited."
1875,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In the present study, for the first time, we explored the function of MLL1 in neuron apoptosis in ischemic penumbra. We found that MLL1 increased significantly in ischemic penumbra after IS onset, and the upregulated MLL1 was recruited to the promoter region of ASK-1 to catalyze H3K4me3 in this region and further promoted the expression of ASK-1 and enhanced the activation of ASK-1/TNF-α-mediated apoptosis. ASK-1 is a cytosolic protein, and TNF-α is an extracellular protein; these two proteins interacted indirectly based on their interactions with the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR1; Han et al.,). TNFR1 is a transmembrane molecule. After the initiation of TNFR1, the TNFR1-associated death domain (TRADD) protein is shuttled from TNFR1 to the cytoplasm and then interacts with the Fas-associated via death domain (FADD) protein and caspase to generate apoptosis complex to amplify TNF-α-induced apoptosis (Micheau and Jürg,). MM102, a small-molecule inhibitor, was further used to investigate the function of MLL1. We built an in vitro model to estimate whether MM102 could cross the BBB. In vitro BBB models have been in use for decades and have been of great benefit in the process of investigating and understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BBB establishment. However, there are still some differences between the in vitro model of BBB and the in vivo one (Czupalla et al.,). First, BMECs are known to dedifferentiate in vitro, and the characteristics of BMECs will gradually disappear with the extension of culture time; then, the function of these cells will be affected. Second, the in vivo BBB is composed of BMECs, astrocytes, and pericytes; however, the in vitro model we used in this study only consists of BMECs and astrocytes and that may cripple the barrier function of BBB. Third, the in vitro BBB models always rely on Transwell chambers for functional measurements, while BMECs behave differently according to their growth surface, so the different cultural materials may lead to different results. Due to these defects, the results should be explained cautiously. In our study, results of the in vitro study showed that MM102 could cross the BBB, and in vivo inhibition of MLL1 alleviated neurological damage caused by IS; these both suggest that MM102 is an effective molecule for IS treatment."
1876,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Additionally, we observed that serum MLL1 level was positively correlated with that in ischemic penumbra from MCAO mouse, indicating the feasibility to detect MLL1 by minimally invasive means. Since serum MLL1 level was positively correlated with that in ischemic core and penumbra in MCAO mice, we speculated that MLL1 was released from the damaged neurocytes into the blood. MLL1 mRNA in the serum might also be from the damaged vessels, blood cells, and/or cells in other organs affected by the systemic inflammatory response (Anrather and Costantino,). What is more, we found that MLL1 expression showed a rapid increase within the primary 2 h after IS onset and remained a stable level within 2–48 h. This will promise us plenty of time to diagnose patients, and it also suggests that detecting MLL1 in IS patients is feasible and credible. To verify the prognostic value of MLL1, we followed up 220 patients, and the results revealed that high serum MLL1 level indicated higher mortality and a poorer functional outcome, and these results were consistent with the results that serum MLL1 level was positively correlated with NIHSS scores, infarct volume, and Hs-CRP level of IS patients."
1877,PMC7394220,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In conclusion, the current study explored the function of MLL1 in neuron apoptosis and found that MLL1 served as a proapoptosis factor in the ischemic penumbra. Besides, serum MLL1 level is an effective indicator to reflect disease severity and to indicate the prognosis of IS. These results may provide us the theoretical basis for a new therapeutic target for IS."

1900,PMC7695371,TITLE,front,Mimetics of extra virgin olive oil phenols with anti-cancer stem cell activity
1901,PMC7695371,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) dihydroxy-phenol oleacein is a natural inhibitor of multiple metabolic and epigenetic enzymes capable of suppressing the functional traits of cancer stem cells (CSC). Here, we used a natural product-inspired drug discovery approach to identify new compounds that phenotypically mimic the anti-CSC activity of oleacein. We coupled 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship-based virtual profiling with phenotypic analysis using 3D tumorsphere formation as a gold standard for assessing the presence of CSC. Among the top 20 computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics, four fulfilled the phenotypic endpoint of specifically suppressing the tumorsphere-initiating capacity of CSC, in the absence of significant cytotoxicity against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D cultures in the same low micromolar concentration range. Of these, 3,4-dihydrophenetyl butyrate –a lipophilic ester conjugate of the hydroxytyrosol moiety of oleacein– and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide) –an inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi triosephosphate isomerase– were also highly effective at significantly reducing the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive CSC-like proliferating cells. Preservation of the mTOR/DNMT binding mode of oleacein was dispensable for suppression of the ALDH+-CSC functional phenotype in hydroxytyrosol-unrelated mimetics. The anti-CSC chemistry of complex EVOO phenols such as oleacein can be phenocopied through the use of mimetics capturing its physico-chemical properties."
1902,PMC7695371,INTRO,title_1,INTRODUCTION
1903,PMC7695371,INTRO,paragraph,"Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is a unique functional food with a major contribution to the health-promoting effects of the so-called Mediterranean diet. EVOO contains a group of complex phenol-conjugated compounds named oleosidic secoiridoids or oleosides that exert nutritional and beneficial effects on major aging-driven diseases including cancer. Using a holistic approach for phenotypic drug discovery coupled with mechanism-of-action functional profiling and target deconvolution, we recently identified the dihydroxy-phenol oleacein (the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol) as a metabolo-epigenetic inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Oleacein was found to specifically and potently suppressing the functional traits of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells (CSC) in genetically diverse types of cancer cell populations."
1904,PMC7695371,INTRO,paragraph,"The anti-CSC effects of oleacein are most likely related to its chemical structure, largely due to the presence of two hydroxyl groups in the hydroxytyrosol moiety. Therefore, one could envision that its scaffold might be used as a chemical prototype to facilitate selection and advancement of new anti-CSC hits via cell-based phenotypic screenings. However, a recent delineation of the high-level functions of oleacein in terms of biomolecular interactions, signaling pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks revealed that the so-called oleacein target landscape likely involved more than 700 proteins rather than solely mTOR and DNMTs. Thus, although the ability of oleacein to operate as a multi-faceted regulator of numerous metabolic processes and chromatin-modifying enzymatic activities might open new horizons for CSC-targeted therapy based on the molecular bridge that connects metabolism and epigenetics with the aberrant state of stemness in cancer tissues, a biomimicry design process of oleacein mimetics remains a highly challenging task."
1905,PMC7695371,INTRO,paragraph,"Here, we used a natural-product-inspired drug discovery approach to identify new small molecules capable of phenotypically mimicking the anti-CSC actions of oleacein. Using the structure of oleacein as a “seed”, we coupled 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR)-based virtual profiling (VP) with laboratory-based phenotypic testing using tumorsphere-formation potential as a gold standard for evaluating the presence of CSC (Figure 1). We provide evidence that oleacein can be phenocopied through the use of mimetics with anti-CSC activity, which might guide the design of synthetically tractable small molecules capable of phenotypically imitating the anti-CSC chemistry of complex EVOO phenolics."

1909,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"When a 2D similarity, ligand-based VP program was executed over the Chembl(v19) database using the Tanimoto coefficient and 2D (Morgan/circular) fingerprints, only the closely related secoiridoid molecule oleocanthal (CHEMBL2172394) was identified. The execution of a comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA)-based 3D VP program, however, identified several compounds with physico-chemical similarity scores greater than 0.75 (Figure 1). Taking advantage of the previously described binding modes of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT, we ran rigid-docking calculations to characterize the binding modes of the top 20 oleacein mimetics (Supplementary Figure 1), both at the crystallographic sites and at additional cavities occurring within the whole protein structures of mTOR and DNMT (Supplementary Tables 1–3). Table 1 summarizes the computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics ranked according to reweighted energies based on short molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area solvation (MM/GBSA) calculations, for both the crystallographic and the best mTOR/DNMT cavities for each of the selected oleacein mimetics (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5)."
1910,PMC7695371,RESULTS,title_2,Binding modes of oleacein mimetics to mTOR and DNMT
1911,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"The binding mode of oleacein to mTOR was predicted to share key amino acid residues with the binding modes of second-generation ATP-competitive TORKinhibs and, consequently, partially mimicked the binding behavior of PP242 and Torin 2 to the ATP-binding catalytic pocket. But, the presence of more aromatic rings in the oleacein molecule resulted in a slightly different binding strength from that of PP242 and Torin 2. Similarly, the presence of aromatic rings notably influenced the binding of the selected oleacein mimetics to mTOR (Figure 2). In fact, we predicted three different binding modes, one of them involving 5 oleacein mimetics that apparently shared the originally described binding mode of parental oleacein; and another two models encompassing 13 compounds and 2 compounds showing a binding mode closely resembling that of TORKinhibs (Figure 2). Rigid docking calculations originally predicted that π-π stacking would occur between the aromatic ring of oleacein and the Trp2239 residue (or Tyr2225 upon conformational changes of either oleacein or the mTOR catalytic pocket itself) in the catalytic site of mTOR. MD simulations confirmed the main occurrence of π-π stacking with Trp2239 (and a more fluctuating interaction with Tyr2225), as well as a significant number of additional residues providing key electrostatic interactions. In the case of oleacein mimetics, it was evident that Trp2239, Tyr2225, and Phe2358 played a central role in the stabilization of their respective complexes with mTOR (Supplementary Table 6)."

1913,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"The binding mode of oleacein to DNMT was predicted to closely resemble that of DNMT inhibitors such as 5-azacytidine, SGI-110, and curcumin. In the case of oleacein mimetics, we were able to predict two different binding modes (Figure 3): one of them shared the oleacein pattern of spatial orientation and included 17 compounds and another one involved only 3 molecules (Figure 3). Rigid docking calculations and MD simulations predicted that the main residues involved in the stabilization of the oleacein-DNMT complex were Ser1446, Pro1125, Asp1143, Phe1145, Gly1150, Leu1151, Asn1158, Val1580, and Gly1223, along with a significant number of additional residues providing key electrostatic interactions. In the case of oleacein mimetics, Phe1145, Trp1170, Pro1224, and Pro1225 were predicted as the main catalytic residues (Supplementary Table 7)."

1916,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"To explicitly test the oleacein mimetics on CSC, we measured their effect on in vitro tumorsphere formation in low-density non-adherent serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors, considered one of the gold standards for evaluating CSC self-renewal activity. As a source of CSC, we used the CSC-enriched triple-negative breast cancer model MDA-MB-436, which can form smooth and round tumorspheres (mammospheres) in suspension culture. The Cell2Sphere™ assay was used to evaluate the differential ability of oleacein mimetics to specifically suppress the ability of CSC to survive and proliferate as floating 3D microtumors without promoting nonspecific, cytotoxic effects on the same cells grown in 2D adherent, differentiating conditions (Figure 4)."

1921,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"Oleacein selectively suppresses functional traits of CSC such as the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), a well-recognized marker of tumorigenic cell fractions enriched for proliferating, epithelial-like CSC capable of self-renewal. We next selected the 2 oleacein mimetics with the best CSC-targeted profile (i.e., anti-CSC activity at low micromolar range and lack of cytotoxic activity against differentiated cancer cells), namely CHEMBL1950046 (3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate; a.k.a. hydroxytyrosol butyrate) and CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), to evaluate their capacity to target epithelial-like CSC cells with high levels of ALDH1 (ALDH1+). To do this, we used the Aldefluor® reagent, which quantifies ALDH activity by measuring the conversion of the ALDH substrate BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde to the fluorescent product BODIPY aminoacetate (Figure 6A). Using HER2-overexpressing BT-474 cells as a breast cancer model naturally enriched with ALDH1+ cells, we detected a significant decrease (up to 63% reduction) in the number of ALDH1+ cells when BT-474 cells were treated with a non-cytotoxic concentration (10 μmol/L) of CHEMBL1950046 (hydroxytyrosol butyrate). A more pronounced effect was seen with CHEMBL1632504 ((E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), which significantly decreased the proportion of ALDH+ cells from 40±2% in untreated BT-474 cells to levels as low as 2±1% (96% reduction). To corroborate the ability of oleacein mimetics to target ALDH1+ epithelial-like CSC irrespective of the mutational landscape of cancer cells, we employed triple-negative MDA-MB-436 cells as a second breast cancer model naturally enriched with ALDH1+ cells. Treatment with hydroxytyrosol butyrate decreased the ALDH1+ cell content of MDA-MB-436 by approximately 40%. Remarkably, the large population of ALDH1+ cells in untreated MDA-MB-436 cultures (42±8%) was drastically reduced by 93% (from 42±8% to 3±1%) in the presence of (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide."

1923,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,Preservation of the oleacein binding mode is required for a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity but not for their anti-CSC behavior of oleacein mimetics. We finally evaluated whether the selected mimetics hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide preserved the dual anti-mTOR/DNMTactivity of the parental oleacein.
1924,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,We first employed the FRET-based Z-LYTE™ Kinase Assay to test the ability of the selected oleacein mimetics to inhibit mTOR activity. Ten concentrations of hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide spanning over five logarithmic decades were selected. Figure 6B shows the mTOR activity rate as a function of oleacein mimetics concentration. Hydroxytyrosol butyrate inhibited mTOR activity with an IC50 of ~39 μmol/L; (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide was unable to decrease mTOR activity even at the maximum concentration tested.
1925,PMC7695371,RESULTS,paragraph,"We finally carried out a radioisotope-based methyltransferase profiling measuring the DNMT3A-catalyzed incorporation of S-adenosyl-L[methyl-3H]methionine (SAM[3H]) into DNA (DNA 5-[methyl-3H]-cytosine) in the absence or presence of oleacein mimetics. The selected oleacein mimetics were tested in 10-dose IC50 mode with 2-fold serial dilution and reactions were carried out at 1 μmol/L SAM. Although hydroxytyrosol butyrate decreased DNMT3A activity in a dose-dependent manner, concentrations higher than 150 μmol/L were necessary to reach the IC50 value. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide did not reach the half maximal inhibitory concentration of DNMT3a activity even at the highest concentration tested."
1926,PMC7695371,DISCUSS,title_1,DISCUSSION
1927,PMC7695371,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The molecular frameworks of natural products can provide feasible and innovative templates for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. But, despite the long tradition of natural product-inspired discovery of synthetic compounds, there has been little effort to utilize EVOO biophenols chemotypes as a springboard for lead discovery. Here, we carried out such a drug discovery approach to uncover new compounds capable of phenotypically mimicking the anti-CSC effects of the EVOO dihydroxy-phenol oleacein."
1928,PMC7695371,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We took advantage of modern bioinformatics approaches with the aim of identifying physicochemical mimetics of the anti-CSC behavior of EVOO-derived oleacein. First, the somewhat structurally complex framework of the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (i.e., oleacein) was computationally captured in terms of molecules with oleacein-like physico-chemical profiles. Second, we in silico compared the binding modes of the top 20 computationally-predicted oleacein mimetics to the two molecular targets originally involved in the capacity of oleacein to specifically suppress the functional traits of tumor-initiating CSC (i.e., mTOR and DNMT). Third, we phenotypically explored the computationally-discovered oleacein biomimetics in terms of their anti-CSC activity. Fourth, we evaluated the structure-mTOR/DNMT bioactivity relationship of the most promising oleacein-mimetic candidates. By doing so, four oleacein mimetics, namely N’-[4-nitro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propane-1,3-diamine, (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, N-(4-nitrobenzyl)ethenesulfonamide, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl butyrate (a.k.a. hydroxytyrosol butyrate), fulfilled the first phenotypic endpoint of the selection criteria, which was the specific suppression of the 3D mammosphere forming capability of CSC in the low micromolar range without highly significant cytotoxic effects against differentiated cancer cells growing in 2D cultures in the same range of concentrations. Moreover, non-cytotoxic concentrations of the oleacein mimetics hydroxytyrosol butyrate and (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide efficiently suppressed the population of ALDH1+ epithelial-like proliferating CSC, a second phenotypic endpoint of the selection criteria for anti-CSC candidates."
1929,PMC7695371,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The fact that the oleacein mimetics-responsive phenotypes were exclusively manifested under 3D stem cell culture conditions along with their capacity to specifically and potently suppress (>90%) ALDH1+ CSC-like cellular states irrespective of the mutational landscape of the cancer cell population strongly suggested that their mechanism of action targets the biological functioning of cancer stemness per se. Hydroxytyrosol butyrate is a chemically-modified (alkyl ester) lipophilic version of hydroxytyrosol that is more stable than parental hydroxytyrosol under biological conditions. The fact that the inclusion of a short-medium lipophilic chain in the hydroxytyrosol molecule sufficed to recapitulate, at least in part, both the anti-CSC behavior and the anti-mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity of the parental oleacein highlights the functional relevance of the dihydroxybenzene moiety within the phenolic part of oleacein, a scaffold that seems to be a crucial mediator of the metabolo-epigenetic modulatory effects of oleacein (e.g., COMT, IDH1, LSD1) via formation of stacking interactions, coordination with metal ions, and/or establishment of hydrophobic and/or hydrogen bond interactions through the hydroxyl groups or the aromatic ring (Figure 6C). The second oleacein scaffold, which comprises the secoiridoid dialdehyde part, might be involved in the stabilization of oleacein via hydrophobic interactions within the binding pocket of the targeted proteins. Accordingly, although hydroxytyrosol butyrate preserved the original double occupancy of oleacein within the catalytic sites of mTOR and DNMT, the sole dihydroxybenzene moiety does not suffice to fully preserve the low-micromolar biological activity of oleacein against mTOR and DNMT enzymatic activities. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, originally described as an inhibitor of the Trypanosoma cruzi triosephosphate isomerase, lacked the original binding sites of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT, thereby fully losing the original ability of oleacein to operate as a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitor. (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide, however, appeared to operate as an optimized mimetic of oleacein capable of exhibiting a very promising and potent activity against ALDH1-positive breast CSC. These findings can be consistent with the notion that preservation of the original binding mode of oleacein to mTOR and DNMT is an obligatory requirement for a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity of hydroxytyrosol-related oleacein mimetics (e.g., hydroxytyrosol butyrate) with anti-CSC activity; for hydroxytyrosol-unrelated oleacein mimetics (e.g., (E)-N-allyl-2-((5-nitrofuran-2-yl)methylene)hydrazinecarbothioamide), however, the absence of a dual mTOR/DNMT inhibitory activity is dispensable for an efficient suppression of the ALDH+-CSC functional phenotype."
1930,PMC7695371,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence that the pharma-nutritional properties of oleacein that elicit its functioning as an anti-CSC compound can be phenocopied through the use of mimetics that capture its physico-chemical properties. Although we acknowledge that further studies are needed to validate the ability of oleacein mimetics to functionally deplete tumor-initiating CSC-like states in vivo and the mechanisms underlying their mode of action, it is reasonable to suggest that a biomimicry design process might guide the development of synthetically tractable small molecules capable of phenotypically imitating the anti-CSC chemistry of complex EVOO phenolics such as oleacein."

1977,PMC7751489,TITLE,front,"CBX2 depletion inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells by inactivating the YAP/β-catenin pathway"
1978,PMC7751489,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the most common and fast-growing malignancy of the digestive system, which has a high mortality. Chromobox homolog 2 (CBX2) has been reported to be highly expressed in cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. It has also been established that CBX2 is upregulated in GC cell lines by searching the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. The aim of the present study was to investigate the biomolecular role and underlying mechanism of CBX2 in the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells. Short hairpin RNA-CBX2 and yes-associated protein (YAP) overexpression plasmids were constructed to regulate CBX2 and YAP expression, respectively. Additionally, the expression of certain mRNAs and proteins involved in the YAP/β-catenin pathway and those associated with cell invasion were assessed by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, respectively. The cellular behaviors of MFC cells were analyzed using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation wound-healing and Transwell assays. The results of the present study revealed that increased CBX2 expression was observed in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric cells. In addition, CBX2 knockdown inhibited the nuclear cytoplasm translocation of YAP, inducing its phosphorylation, and suppressing the activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. The results also demonstrated that CBX2 depletion inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells by inactivating the YAP/β-catenin pathway. It was determined that CBX2 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells by activating the YAP/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that CBX2 is involved in the pathogenesis of GC and may represent a novel target for the clinical treatment of GC."
1979,PMC7751489,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
1980,PMC7751489,INTRO,paragraph,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung and colorectal cancer) worldwide and is the most common and fast-growing malignancy of the digestive system with a high mortality. It is estimated that >1,000,000 new cases of GC were diagnosed (5.7% of the overall cancer incidence) and 800,000 deaths occurred (8.2% of all cancer mortalities) in 2018 worldwide. Furthermore, according to previous studies, patients with GC regularly exhibit partial metastasis at diagnosis or during chemotherapy. Despite advances in GC diagnostic techniques, surgery and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, the 5-year survival rate remains poor in China, particularly at advanced stages. Owing to the complexity of the pathogenesis of GC, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. CBX2 is widely considered to be a tumor-promoting gene. Due to its significant association with large tumor size and lymph node metastasis, it has been reported that CBX2 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and may serve as a novel biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with breast cancer. Additionally, CBX2 has been demonstrated to be upregulated in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which was closely associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, high CBX2 expression is associated with poor clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma, with CBX2 serving regulatory effects on proliferation and apoptosis via the phosphorylation of yes-associated protein (YAP) in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. However, the precise function of CBX2 in GC remains unclear."
1981,PMC7751489,INTRO,paragraph,"As a transcription co-activator of the Hippo family, YAP is a mechanotransduction protein that serves a key role in proliferation, differentiation and organ size. Emerging evidence has determined that abnormal YAP activation is involved in the growth of certain tumors, including liver and prostate cancer. A previous study demonstrated that CBX2 knockdown suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of YAP. YAP1 overexpression has also been demonstrated to promote the proliferation and migration of bladder cancer cells. In addition, increasing evidence has revealed that the aberrant activation of Wnt/β catenin signaling serves a key role in promoting the tumorigenesis and progression of cancer. More importantly, YAP has the ability to induce the nuclear localization and accumulation of β-catenin. It is therefore hypothesized that CBX2 knockdown may inhibit the expression of β catenin signaling by promoting the phosphorylation of YAP and its translocation into the nuclear cytoplasm, which may further inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells."
1982,PMC7751489,INTRO,paragraph,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the biomolecular role and underlying mechanism of CBX2 in GC progression. Thus, GC cell lines were transfected with short hairpin (sh)RNA-CBX2, which was constructed to regulate the expression of CBX2. It was determined that CBX2 knockdown by shRNA inhibited GC cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Thus, CBX2 may serve as an effective target for clinical GC therapy. The present study aimed to investigate the biomolecular role of CBX2 and its underlying mechanism in the pathogenesis of GC."

In the present study, normal gastric GES-1 cells and GC cell lines, including MFC, HGC-27, AGS and MKN-45, were selected to investigate the role of CBX2 in GC. The results demonstrated that CBX2 expression was significantly elevated in GC cells compared with GES-1 cells (Fig. 1B and C). As the highest level of CBX2 was observed in MFC cells, this cell line was selected for further experimentation.

Western blotting was subsequently performed to detect the expression of β-catenin and its various downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1. The results demonstrated that the expression of c-myc, cyclin D1 and nuclear β-catenin in the shRNA-CBX2-1 group were significantly decreased compared with the control, while total β-catenin expression showed no significant difference (Fig. 1E and F).

2007,PMC7751489,RESULTS,paragraph,"To confirm whether the β-catenin signaling pathway is involved in the role of CBX2 in GC, shRNA-DKK1 was synthesized. As DKK1 is a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, DKK1 was silenced to activate β-catenin signaling. Due to its higher transfection efficiency, shRNA-DKK1-1 was selected for further use, as determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 2A). A CCK-8 assay was carried out to evaluate the viability of MFC cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 or shRNA-DKK1-1 at the indicated time points (0, 24, 48 and 72 h). As presented in Fig. 2B, cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 demonstrated a lower viability compared with the control, whereas cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 and shRNA-DKK1-1 demonstrated increased viability compared with shRNA-CBX2-1 transfected cells. A colony formation assay was subsequently performed to determine MFC cell proliferation. As presented in Fig. 2C, MFC cell proliferation was suppressed by shRNA-CBX2-1 transfection, which was subsequently abolished by shRNA-DKK1-1 transfection. These data suggested that CBX2 knockdown inhibited the proliferation of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin signaling pathway."

It has been demonstrated that MMP7 and MMP13 are significantly upregulated in malignant tumors, and are associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. As presented in Fig. 3E, the expression of MMP7 and MMP13 were significantly downregulated in MFC cells transfected with shRNA-CBX2-1 compared with controls.

2011,PMC7751489,RESULTS,paragraph,"The present study determined that CBX2 promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of GC cells by inactivating the β-catenin pathway. However, the specific molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. To determine the underlying mechanism associated with the effect of CBX2 in GC, the expression of P-YAP, cytoplasmic YAP and nuclear YAP were detected via western blotting. The results demonstrated that the phosphorylation of YAP in the shRNA-CBX2-1 group was significantly upregulated compared with the control, whereas the expression levels of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP were downregulated (Fig. 4). The results revealed that CBX2 exerted a regulatory effect on YAP expression."

2013,PMC7751489,RESULTS,paragraph,"To further investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the effect of CBX2 and GC, a YAP overexpression plasmid was constructed. The expression of YAP was analyzed via RT-qPCR and western blotting. As presented in Fig. 5A, YAP expression was increased in MFC cells transfected with overexpression-YAP plasmids compared with control cells. Additionally, western blotting was performed to evaluate the expression of β-catenin and its downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1, after transfection with or without shRNA-CBX2-1 and overexpression-YAP plasmids. The results demonstrated that shRNA-CBX2-1 transfection led to a significant reduction in the expression of the aforementioned proteins, which was consistent with Fig. 1D. As predicted, YAP overexpression attenuated the suppressive effect of CBX2 knockdown on protein expression (Fig. 5B). Therefore, these data indicated that CBX2 promoted GC pathogenesis by activating the YAP/β-catenin pathway."
2014,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
2015,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The incidence of digestive tract tumors has significantly increased following the improvement of human living standards, due to the change of diet and habits. GC is the most common and aggressive form of digestive tract cancer worldwide. There are great limitations on the understanding of GC etiology and pathogenesis, owing to the multifaceted process and complex molecular mechanism that contribute to the tumorigenesis and progression of GC. Hence, it is of great importance to investigate the underlying mechanisms of GC pathogenesis and to determine effective molecular targets for GC therapy."
2016,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,paragraph,"CBX2, a member of chromobox family, is an essential regulator of cancer progression and the cell cycle. It has been reported that CBX2 exerts an oncogenic effect on osteosarcoma progression and promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and metastasis. A previous study demonstrated that CBX2 knockdown markedly suppressed the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells and promoted apoptosis. In the present study, increased CBX2 expression was observed in GC cell lines compared with normal gastric cells, indicating that CBX may serve an important role in GC onset and development. Additionally, CBX2 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells, which was consistent with the results of the aforementioned studies. Thus, CBX may serve as a novel molecular target."
2017,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Growing evidence has demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is downregulated in normal cells, and significantly upregulated in cancer cells, indicating that is has an important role in cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. The present study revealed that CBX2 knockdown inhibited nuclear localization and β-catenin accumulation, and suppressed the expression of its downstream proteins, including c-myc and cyclin D1, suggesting that CBX2 promoted tumorigenesis and progression in GC via the β-catenin pathway. To confirm whether the β-catenin pathway was involved in the role of CBX2 in GC, the expression of DKK1, which is a negative regulator of β-catenin signaling, was silenced. DKK1 knockdown inhibited the suppressive effect of CBX2 knockdown on GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that CBX2 promoted GC cell proliferation and metastasis by activating the β-catenin pathway. However, further experiments are required to investigate the specific mechanism of the role of CBX2 in GC."
2018,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,paragraph,"YAP is a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, which mediates the phosphorylation of YAP. P-YAP binds to other proteins and cannot translocate into the cell nucleus, and is subsequently degraded by ubiquitination in the cytoplasm, thereby leading to the inactivation of YAP. According to a previous study, YAP served a crucial role in organ growth and cell proliferation. Furthermore, YAP was reported to contribute to tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Tang et al demonstrated that the expression of β-catenin was markedly reduced after YAP downregulation in laryngeal cancer cells. Wang et al also reported that P-YAP contributed to the degradation of β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells. Thus, YAP may represent an effective target in anticancer therapy. In the present study, YAP overexpression plasmids were transfected into GC cells to induce YAP upregulation. The results demonstrated that CBX2 knockdown elevated P-YAP levels and inhibited YAP expression in the cytoplasm and nucleus, suggesting that CBX2 knockdown promoted YAP translocation, causing the degradation of cytoplasmic YAP. In addition, YAP inhibition suppressed the expression of β-catenin and its downstream signaling molecules, including c-myc and cyclin D1, which is consistent with the results of the present study. The current study revealed that YAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of CBX2 knockdown on the β-catenin pathway. The results indicated that CBX2 regulated the GC cell cycle, migration and invasion via the YAP/β-catenin pathway. The present study provided evidence to support that CBX2 may be an effective target for GC treatment. However, the present study had several limitations. For example, FBS was used in culture medium contained a mixture of growth factors, which may have affected the present results. Additionally, further studies will be performed to fully elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the role of CBX2 in GC progression."
2019,PMC7751489,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, the present study demonstrated that CBX2 was significantly upregulated in GC cells. CBX2 knockdown led to the suppression of the β-catenin pathway, and the promotion of YAP phosphorylation and translocation. The results suggested that CBX2 promoted GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by activating the YAP/β-catenin pathway. CBX2 may represent a novel and promising therapeutic target for GC."

2042,PMC8566808,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Understanding of the basis for severity and fatal outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection is of paramount importance for developing therapeutic options and identification of prognostic markers. So far, accumulation of neutrophils and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we aimed to compare circulatory levels of neutrophil secretory proteins, alpha-defensins (DEFA1), calprotectin (S100A8/A9), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations. We studied 19 healthy subjects, 63 COVID-19 patients with mild (n=32) and severe (n=31) disease, 23 asymptomatic individuals identified through contact tracing programme and 23 recovering patients (1-4 months post-disease). At the time of disease presentation, serum levels of DEFA1 were significantly higher in patients with mild (mean230 ± 17, p<0.0001) and severe (mean452 ± 46, p<0.0001) disease respectively in comparison to healthy subjects (mean113 ± 11). S100A8/A9 proteins were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients (p<0.0001) irrespective of disease severity. The levels of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO reduced to normal in recovering patients and comparable to healthy subjects. Surprisingly, DEFA1 levels were higher in severe than mild patients in first week of onset of disease (p=0.004). Odds-ratio analysis showed that DEFA1 could act as potential biomarker in predicting disease severity (OR=11.34). In addition, levels of DEFA1 and S100A8/A9 were significantly higher in patients with fatal outcome (p=0.004 and p=0.03) respectively. The rise in DEFA1 levels was independent of secondary infections. In conclusion, our data suggest that induction of elevated levels of alpha-defensins and S100A8/A9 is associated with poor disease outcome in COVID-19 patients."
2043,PMC8566808,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
2044,PMC8566808,INTRO,paragraph,"COVID-19 is a recently emerged viral disease caused by a betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The viral infection has spread globally in a short span of time affecting 196 million people and causing approximately 4.2 million deaths as of 29th July 2021 (John Hopkins University Coronavirus tracker)."
2045,PMC8566808,INTRO,paragraph,"Majority of the infected individuals exhibit either no or mild symptoms and about 15% develop severe pneumonia with approximately 6% progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiorgan failure. Inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha have been identified as independent predictors of disease severity and clinical outcome. Even, spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is reported to induce inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. One of the hypotheses for progression to serious disease complications is imbalanced host immune response with ineffective early innate immunity followed by impaired adaptive immune responses and hyper-inflammation."
2046,PMC8566808,INTRO,paragraph,"Several studies reported alterations in both innate and adaptive arms of the host immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. During airway infections, neutrophils are the first line of defense. In response to viral infection, neutrophils migrate to the site of infection and initiate the antiviral defense mechanism. Recent studies have reported accumulation of neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients compared to non-severe patients. In a COVID-19 patient with fatal outcome, large number of neutrophils were found in autopsied lung infiltrates. Moreover, increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients suggest that neutrophil activation may modulate immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Upon neutrophil activation or death, alarmins including alpha-defensins, S100A8/A9 heterodimers (calprotectin) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) proteins are released extracellularly in circulation. Till date, COVID-19 pathogenesis has focused on macrophages, T and B cells. It has been suggested that neutrophilia is associated with disease severity in COVID-19. However, it is still unknown whether neutrophils drive the inflammation or act as bystanders. In this study, we aimed to quantitate the circulatory levels of neutrophil’s secretory proteins in different clinical presentations of COVID-19 patients."

As evident from  Figure 3 , the expression levels of all the three proteins were similar in both the groups ( Figure 3A ). We further compared the expression of all the three proteins in relation to the duration between the day of secondary diagnosis and sampling ( Figures 3B–D ).

No difference in the levels of MPO protein was observed (p=0.56). Comparison of these proteins in severe patients requiring mechanical ventilation revealed that the rise was independent of the use of mechanical ventilator for oxygen support ( Figure 3F ). Furthermore, odds-ratio analysis revealed that poor outcome of the disease was strongly associated with the requirement of mechanical ventilation by the patients suffering from severe illness (OR = 12)."
2073,PMC8566808,RESULTS,paragraph,"To examine the possible contribution of mechanical ventilation or secondary infection in raising the DEFA1 levels in severe patients, a separate analysis was undertaken. DEFA1 levels were significantly higher when patients with severe disease without these confounding factors (n=11; 385±65 ng/mL) were compared patients with mild disease (n=32; 230±17 ng/mL, p=0.02). Thus, higher expression of DEFA1 during severe COVID-19 infection was independent of mechanical ventilation or secondary infection."

2075,PMC8566808,RESULTS,paragraph,"To explore, if DEFA1 levels can be used to differentiate between mild and severe disease presentations, three different concentrations of DEFA1 were evaluated (250, 300 and 350 ng/mL). At 250ng/mL, DEFA1 could differentiate between mild and severe disease presentations (OR = 3.68). At 300 ng/mL DEFA1 concentration, odds-ratio increased to 11.34 and at 350ng/mL DEFA1 concentration, odds ratio further increased to 13.38. ROC curve analysis revealed that at 314 ng/mL, the estimated sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 91% respectively ( Figure 3G ). The AUC value for alpha-defensin was 0.78 ± 0.06 (95% CI = 0.66 to 0.89, p<0.0002), suggesting that DEFA1 levels could act as a potential biomarker in predicting disease severity in COVID-19."

2077,PMC8566808,RESULTS,paragraph,"Certain clinical parameters such as Neutrophils to Lymphocytes ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer have been associated with severity of COVID-19. We attempted to correlate these parameters with known significance with the proteins evaluated in this study ( Figure 4 ). DEFA1 levels were found to be positively correlated with NLR (r=0.42, p=0.02). S100A8/A9 expression levels were found to be positively correlated with CRP (r=0.36, p=0.05)."

2079,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
2080,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"This study provides comparative, circulatory expression profiles of DEFA1, S100A8/A9 and MPO in COVID-19 patients with different clinical presentations. Though SARS-CoV-2 infection involves neutrophil activation, a marked difference was noted in the association of these markers with disease severity. Of note, raised DEFA1 and MPO levels characterized symptomatic infections while elevated levels of calprotectin marked SARS-CoV-2 infections irrespective of clinical presentation ( Figure 1 ). Further, MPO and calprotectin levels did not differ among patients with mild or severe disease. An important observation was a significant rise in DEFA1 levels during the first week post-disease onset in severe than non-severe patients ( Figure 2A ). Odds-ratio analysis showed that DEFA1 could act as potential biomarker in predicting disease severity (OR=11.34). Of note, at 314 ng/mL DEFA1 levels, accurate prediction of disease severity in differentiating mild from severe disease patients could be determined with 68% sensitivity and 91% specificity ( Figure 3G ). This significant observation with small numbers need to be extended to a larger cohort with prospective follow-up studies."
2081,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Single cell RNA sequencing analyses showed the increased presence of dysfunctional neutrophils expressing S100A8, S100A9, DEFA3 and DEFA4 genes in the PBMCs of severe COVID-19 patients suggesting association of the phenotypic alterations in neutrophils with disease severity. Very recently, increased serum DEFA1 levels were reported in COVID-19 patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome. Other clinical presentations were not studied. Contrary to the biomarker role of alpha-defensins, antiviral role of DEFA1 was established in in-vitro wherein HNP1 inhibited the viral infection at the step of viral entry by disrupting the fusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with host membrane. Similarly, antiviral activity of intestinal alpha-defensin, HD-5 released from Paneth cells and of β-defensin, hBD-2 was shown to be due to blocking of the entry of spike expressing pseudovirus into ACE2 expressing cells. At the site of infection, neutrophils can exert their antiviral activities by increasing the expression of peptides such as, defensins and promote degranulation. However, excessive release of defensins and neutrophil elastase led to cell death of bronchial epithelial cells thereby increasing permeability of blood vessels and causing acute lung injury. The mechanism(s) by which defensins contribute to disease severity during SARS-CoV-2 infection are not yet known."
2082,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Elevated calprotectin levels in the blood of COVID-19 patients with severe disease are consistent with a study from Michigan, USA. In addition, we report that elevation of calprotectin was a function of SARS-CoV-2 infection and was not related to disease severity. The observation of higher expression of S100A8 and S100A9 genes in the PBMCs of the patients with severe disease but not in patients with mild disease is noteworthy. The discrepancy between gene expression and protein levels (this study) could be due to differences in sampling timings, increase only at transcription level or transient rise in the circulatory proteins missed by our study. In children suffering with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) after SARS-CoV-2 infection, rise in S100 protein levels was similar to other inflammatory disorder such, as Kawasaki disease. Disease severity was associated with increased, circulatory S100B protein levels as well."
2083,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"So far, several multi-omics studies revealed that genes involved in neutrophil function and activation are highly upregulated and neutrophil degranulation is the most prominent defense pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Elevated levels of MPO in nasopharyngeal samples of COVID-19 patients were identified by proteomic analysis. Our observations of increased expression of alpha defensins and calprotectin in severe patients on the 1st day of hospitalization are in line with previous proteomic profiling study. Of note, fatal outcome was associated with a further rise in the expression of DEFA1 and calprotectin levels in the patients with severe disease ( Figure 3E ) and 91% required mechanical ventilation. These results confirm the findings of. Taken together, it seems that neutrophil activation signature can predict mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, there was a distinct possibility of the role of secondary infections in modulating the expression of three neutrophil secretory proteins in severe COVID-19 patients. Importantly, similar to the reports of higher proportion of secondary infection in patients from China, Italy, France and UK, 61% of severe patients from our study suffered from secondary infection. The observations of raised levels of these proteins much before the appearance of secondary infection ( Figures 3B–D ) provide important evidence for the association of higher expression levels of DEFA1/Calprotectin/MPO levels with COVID-19 severity. Moreover, the significant rise in DEFA1 levels in severe patients in comparison of patients with mild disease was independent of any confounding factors associated with disease severity (p=0.02). In our study, 53% of patients undergoing early intubation (0-3 days after hospitalization) developed secondary infection. This is in line with findings that mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients are at high risk of developing secondary infection."
2084,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Multiple models have predicted neutrophils, lymphocytes, C-reactive protein (a biomarker for inflammation), and D-dimer (a measure of blood clotting) as markers for disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings of increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio along with raised D-dimer and CRP levels in the patients with severe disease confirm earlier observations. A positive correlation was obtained between increased neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio with increased levels of DEFA1 in severe patients. A weak positive correlation between CRP and calprotectin levels was also observed in our study, probably due to small sample size. It is pertinent to note here that calprotectin was found to be superior than CRP in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation at any point during their hospitalization. Circulatory calprotectin was identified as an independent variable influencing disease severity. Recognizing potential role of alpha defensins and calprotectin in augmenting inflammatory response, a clinical trial using an adjunctive therapy, cytosorb, is underway. This formulation acts by absorbing a broad spectrum of cytokines, DAMPs and PAMPs to reduce their circulatory levels and ameliorate immunopathology."
2085,PMC8566808,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In summary, our data reveals that neutrophil activation as assessed by levels of circulatory alpha defensins and calprotectin varies with disease severity. DEFA1 seems to be a potential biomarker of severity, needing further evaluation. Association of raised DEFA1 and calprotectin with poor clinical outcome raises possibility of crucial roles of these molecules in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Given the urgent need for effective treatment of COVID-19 patients, efficacy of anti-neutrophil therapies to combat neutrophil activation needs to be undertaken on priority."

2106,PMC9556722,TITLE,front,The third dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccines enhances the spike-specific antibody and memory B cell response in myelofibrosis patients
2107,PMC9556722,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 using mRNA-based vaccines has been highly recommended for fragile subjects, including myelofibrosis patients (MF). Available data on the immune responsiveness of MF patients to mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and the impact of the therapy with the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, are still fragmented. Here, we profile the spike-specific IgG and memory B-cell response in MF patients, treated or not with ruxolitinib, after the second and the third dose of SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 (BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells samples were collected before vaccination, post the second and the third doses and tested for spike-specific antibodies, ACE2/RBD antibody inhibition binding activity and spike-specific B cells. The third vaccine dose significantly increased the spike-specific IgG titers in both ruxolitinib-treated and untreated patients, and strongly enhanced the percentage of subjects with antibodies capable of in vitro blocking ACE2/RBD interaction, from 50% up to 80%. While a very low frequency of spike-specific B cells was measured in blood 7 days after the second vaccination dose, a strong and significant increase was elicited by the third dose administration, generating a B cell response similar to the one detected in healthy controls. Despite the overall positive impact of the third dose in MF patients, two patients that were under active concomitant immunosuppressive treatment at the time of vaccination, and a patient that received lymphodepleting therapies in the past, remained low responders. The third mRNA vaccine dose strongly increases the SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral and B cell responses in MF patients, promoting a reactivation of the immune response similar to the one observed in healthy controls."
2108,PMC9556722,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
2109,PMC9556722,INTRO,paragraph,"Patients with hematologic malignancies are at an increased risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and report highest disease severity and death rates compared to the general population. Booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been highly recommended and prioritized in fragile categories including patients with myelofibrosis (MF), a clonal hematopoiesis stem cell disorder belonging to the Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). MF is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, progressive cytopenia, and extramedullary hematopoiesis, with complications as anemia, opportunistic infections, and ultimately progression to leukemia in a fraction of patients. MF patients may receive clinical benefits from ruxolitinib, the first approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that deeply reduces inflammatory cytokine production and impairs to some extent cellular immune responses. Indeed, ruxolitinib has been successfully employed in attenuating the cytokine storm responsible of fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe COVID-19 disease, as reported by several studies. On the other hand, the interruption of ruxolitinib treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infected MF patients has been followed by an increase in death rate, probably due to the cytokine rebound subsequent to the drug suspension."
2110,PMC9556722,INTRO,paragraph,"We previously demonstrated a slower kinetic of antibody response in MF patients vaccinated with two doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared to healthy subjects, and a reduced ACE2/RBD inhibition binding capacity of plasma antibodies, especially in concomitance with ruxolitinib treatment. The reduced response in MF patients, particularly if under ruxolitinib treatment, was also confirmed by Cattaneo et al.. The immune response kinetic observed in these subjects, showing a reduced capability of their immune system to rapidly react to vaccination, strongly suggested the need of booster vaccine dose, that was indeed recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for “fragile” subjects. On the matter we indeed recently demonstrated how the third dose of mRNA-1273 improved SARS-CoV-2 immunity in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with autologous and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, which exhibit a low response to the first cycle of vaccination."
2111,PMC9556722,INTRO,paragraph,"Existing data on small groups of MF subjects are focused largely on antibody levels and their ability to neutralize the virus. However, besides the antibody immune response, it’s of critical importance to profile the induction and persistence of antigen-specific cellular immune responses. In particular, memory B cells induced by vaccination are capable of reactivation upon pathogen encounter, with secretion of novel wave of antibodies. For this reason, the assessment of spike-specific B cell response is crucial to characterize the long-term persistence of effective immune responses even beyond the decline of circulating antibodies. Our studies on immune responsiveness in healthy subjects vaccinated with nanoparticles-based mRNA formulations clearly show the persistence of circulating spike-specific antibodies and immune memory B cells six months after the first cycle of vaccination with BNT162b2, and we have followed up their persistence in blood up to 9 months (Ciabattini et al., manuscript in preparation)."
2112,PMC9556722,INTRO,paragraph,"In the present work, we longitudinally profiled the immune response after the second and the third booster dose of mRNA vaccines (Spikevax mRNA-1273 or Comirnaty BNT162b2) in a cohort of MF patients referring to the Hematology Unit of the Siena University Hospital. The analysis focused on the anti-spike antibody response, their ACE2/RBD binding inhibition activity, and the characterization of the spike-specific B cell response, also evaluating the potential impact of ruxolitinib therapy on the vaccine immune responsiveness."

2136,PMC9556722,RESULTS,paragraph,"Taken together, the booster dose administered to MF patients significantly increased the anti-spike IgG response compared to levels observed after the second dose, regardless of the ruxolitinib treatment, and strongly raised the percentage of patients with antibodies capable of inhibiting the ACE2/RBD binding (P<0.05). Compared to HC, the spike-specific antibody response in MF patients was however lower (P<0.05,  Figures 2C, D )."

2138,PMC9556722,RESULTS,paragraph,"The induction of the B cell response upon vaccination is characterized by the production of B cell subpopulations with different functionalities and phenotypes, according to the effector or memory phase of the immune response. Here, we characterized the spike-specific B cell response at the baseline (pre v1), 7 days after the second (post v2) and 15 days after the third (post v3) vaccination in MF patients and HC. SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells were identified using the full-spike protein and RBD as fluorescent probes, and their phenotype was characterized assessing the expression of CD19, CD20, IgD, CD27, CD38, molecules. Spike/RBD-specific cells were detected within the pool of not naïve CD19+ cells (hereafter named S+RBD+ B cells,  Figures 3A, B )."

Undetectable SARS-CoV-2 specific B cells were instead observed in patients treated with ruxolitinib (0.01%). The third dose significantly boosted the SARS-CoV-2 specific B cell response in MF patients with an increase of S+RBD+ B cells to 0.30% and 0.28% in patients without or with ruxolitinib treatment, respectively (P≤0.05), stimulating a B cell response similar to that observed in HC ( Figures 3C, D ). The analysis of the spike+RBD+specific memory B cell response strongly highlights the crucial impact of the third dose on the improvement of the response to the COVID-19 vaccination in this cohort of fragile patients."

Nineteen MF patients, 8 with ruxolitinib (Ruxo) treatment (A, C, E) and 11 without therapy (B, D, F), were monitored after two (post v2) and three (post v3) doses of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to study the kinetic of spike-specific IgG (A, B), the ACE2/RBD binding inhibition activity (C, D) and the spike/+RBD+-specific B cells generated (E, F). Each subject is identified with a number and a color, as reported in the legend."
2144,PMC9556722,RESULTS,paragraph,"The time course analysis of anti-spike IgG clearly shows a two-fold increase in each individual following the third dose, except for patient #583 under ruxolitinib treatment ( Figure 4A ) and for patients #497 and #552 without ruxolitinib treatment ( Figure 4B ), which maintained a low antibody response also after the booster dose. Concomitantly, the three patients were negative for the ACE2/RBD inhibition binding activity ( Figures 4C, D ) and did not develop a spike-specific B cell response ( Figures 4E, F ). Patient #583 was on ruxolitinib and ibrutinib treatment, as he is affected by chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well. His lower immune responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can therefore be due to the immunosuppressive ibrutinib drug, that inhibits B-cell proliferation and survival. Patients #497 and #552, who received only HU or supportive therapy ( Table S1 ), have been treated with, or they were still receiving lymphodepleting therapies at the time of vaccination. In fact, patient #552 was treated for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma few years before, receiving six cycles of immunochemotherapy (R-COP) and a rituximab maintenance therapy, while patient #497 was on chronic therapy with methylprednisolone for fibromyalgia."
2145,PMC9556722,RESULTS,paragraph,"In all the other patients, the third dose of mRNA vaccine considerably enhanced SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and B-cell responses, also in low responder subjects after the second dose (#523, #564, #525), independently of the ruxolitinib treatment. S+RBD+ B cells were observed in 7/8 (87%) ruxolitinib-treated and 7/11 (64%) untreated patients ( Figures 4E, F )."
2146,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
2147,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been strongly recommended for fragile subjects by regulatory authorities. In the present work we demonstrated the impact of the third dose with an mRNA-based vaccine on the immune responsiveness of MF patients, with or without ruxolitinib treatment. To deeply dissect the immune mechanisms elicited by the third dose, we analyzed the amount and the functionality of spike-specific antibodies and the generation of the spike-specific memory B cells, that play a crucial role in response to pathogen encounter."
2148,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We previously demonstrated a slower kinetics of antibody response in MF patients at early time points after the second dose of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine compared to healthy subjects, and a reduced ACE2/RBD inhibition binding especially in subjects under ruxolitinib treatment."
2149,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The analysis of the antibody response following the first vaccination cycle in healthy and fragile subjects indicates that factors such as age, sex, and comorbidities have shown impact on the level of spike-specific IgG levels and the rate at which they decline overtime. Age and comorbidities, which can induce physiological and premature immune senescence, respectively, as well as chronic systemic low-grade inflammation have been considered among the most impacting factors on immune responsiveness to vaccination. Applying a linear multivariate model to assess the impact of the age and sex as confounding factors on the antibody response in this study, no significant effect was observed (data not shown). This can be due to the low number of subjects and a skewing towards an older age of the patients (68% was > 70 years), which constitute a limitation to the present work."
2150,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The reduced capability of the immune system of MF patients to promptly react to vaccination, strongly suggested the need of a third vaccine dose. Public health agencies have advised the administration of a booster dose 4-6 months after the primary series of vaccination is completed, to strengthen protection against serious illness and death from COVID-19, especially for fragile patients. Several studies have described the effect of the third vaccine dose on the humoral immune response and on the protection from infections, without relevant adverse events. We recently provided evidence that a third dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine, in subjects primed with two doses of the same vaccine, substantially increase SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and B-cell response in low responder hematopoietic cell transplantation recipients, emphasizing the importance of an additional vaccine dose for those who may have produced a low response upon the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccination. The administration of the third dose has opened the door to heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccination approaches, obtained by the combination of vector- and mRNA-based vaccines, or mixed mRNA platforms. Here, the cohort of MF patients included 17 subjects vaccinated with homologous mRNA vaccines and only 2 primed with Spikevax and boosted with Comirnaty mRNA vaccine, therefore it was not possible to make a comparison of immunogenicity between the different prime-boost strategies. Nevertheless, data obtained in healthy subjects support the heterologous combination as a successful strategy for improving immunogenicity and safety, as well as a practical solution to shortages of some vaccines, or to changes in national authorization for some initially licensed vaccines (Pastore et al, in preparation). This approach should be taken in consideration also for vaccination strategies tailored for fragile patients."
2151,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Here, we demonstrated the strong booster effect of the third dose in MF patients in terms of spike-specific IgG levels, ACE2/RBD inhibition binding ability and spike-specific B cells. While other studies have investigated the effect of the third dose only on the antibody response, here we profiled the memory B cells specific for SARS-CoV-2. The characterization of the spike-specific B cell response is particularly relevant since the ability of memory B cells to be promptly re-activated by pathogen encounter and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasmacells, capable of secreting virus neutralizating antibodies. This booster effect was particularly relevant for MF patients that were low responder after the second vaccine dose, independently from ruxolitinib treatment, as reported also by Caocci et al. in MF patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. On the other hand, Auteri at al demonstrated an impaired early humoral response to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms patients receiving ruxolitinib, and extended this issue to the later response as well. The speculation about the impact of ruxolitinib treatment and of the exposition time on the immune response needs to be further investigated, considering the small number of subjects included in difference studies."
2152,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Moreover, we observed a similar frequencies of spike-specific B cells between MF, treated or untreated with ruxolitinib therapy, and HC after the third dose, while a significant lower response in MF was detected after two vaccine doses. These data, showing the slower evolution of spike-specific B cells in MF after two doses, corroborate our previous data on the different kinetic of spike-specific antibody response in MF patients compared to HC, and suggest a reduced capability of their immune system to be rapidly boosted. Despite the observed positive impact of the third dose in most of the MF patients, we observed and reported the case of three patients that maintained a low response also after the booster dose. One of three low responder patients was receiving ruxolitinib treatment at the same time of the first vaccine dose, while the other two were under HU/supportive therapies. Interestingly, all the three patients had received or were receiving lymphodepleting therapies for other pathologies. Patient #583, affected also by chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is in treatment with ibrutinib; patient #552 received a B-cell-depleting treatment with anti CD20 monoclonal antibodies for a non-Hodgkin lymphoma some years ago, without IgG recovery before the vaccination, and patient #497, affected by fibromyalgia, is in chronic therapy with methylprednisolone, that induces lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. As such, in line with other recent reports, the lower response to mRNA vaccines in hematologic patients seems to be influenced by B-cell depleting therapies, hypogammaglobulinemia and immunosuppressive treatment, regardless of therapy with ruxolitinib."
2153,PMC9556722,DISCUSS,paragraph,"These results contribute to answer the open question on the magnitude of spike-specific antibody and B-cell response elicited by COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in MF patients, and on the impact of ruxolitinib treatment on the humoral and cellular immune response generated. Our findings demonstrate that a third dose of mRNA vaccine considerably enhances spike-specific antibody and B-cell response in MF patients, regardless of therapy with ruxolitinib. Data highlight the importance of the third vaccine dose to strongly boost immune response for those who may have achieved a limited response to the primary cycle of COVID-19 vaccination. This knowledge is crucial to assess the need for additional booster doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines and to guide vaccination policies designed for MF patients."

2177,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Purpose
2178,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) has previously been reported to be negatively associated with estrogen receptor (ER) expression. Furthermore, MHC I expression, level of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and expression of interferon (IFN) mediator MxA are positively associated with one another in human breast cancers. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of association of MHC I with ER and IFN signaling."

2180,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-ABC protein expression was analyzed in breast cancer cell lines. The expressions of HLA-A and MxA mRNAs were analyzed in MCF-7 cells in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data. ER and HLA-ABC expressions, Ki-67 labeling index and TIL levels in tumor tissue were also analyzed in ER+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2– breast cancer patients who randomly received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or estrogen modulator treatment followed by resection."

2182,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract,"HLA-ABC protein expression was decreased after β-estradiol treatment or hESR-GFP transfection and increased after fulvestrant or IFN-γ treatment in cell lines. In GEO data, HLA-A and MxA expression was increased after ESR1 shRNA transfection. In patients, ER Allred score was significantly lower and the HLA-ABC expression, TIL levels, and Ki-67 were significantly higher in the estrogen modulator treated group than the chemotherapy treated group."
2183,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Conclusion
2184,PMC9582481,ABSTRACT,abstract,MHC I expression and TIL levels might be affected by ER pathway modulation and IFN treatment. Further studies elucidating the mechanism of MHC I regulation could suggest a way to boost TIL influx in cancer in a clinical setting.
2185,PMC9582481,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
2186,PMC9582481,INTRO,paragraph,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have consistently been reported to play an important role in breast cancer. TILs have a strong prognostic and predictive significance, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). CD8+ cytotoxic TILs are activated by the T cell receptor-recognition of a specific peptide, which is generally generated from endogenous proteins, and are presented by a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) on the surface of tumor cells. The recognition of these peptides by cytotoxic CD8+ TILs triggers a series of events that can result in tumor cell lysis. A better understanding of TILs and related features could facilitate the development of efficient immunotherapeutic approaches in breast cancer."
2187,PMC9582481,INTRO,paragraph,"MHC I proteins are membrane proteins that are expressed on almost all nucleated cells and are encoded by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -C genes. The expression of HLAs varies from tissue to tissue and is largely stimulated by interferon (IFN) signaling. The downregulation of HLAs is frequently observed in tumors and is reported to be correlated with disease progression. Aberrant HLA expression in tumor cells might be caused by alterations in HLA gene transcription, the translation of HLA mRNA, or post-translational modifications. Torigoe et al. established a monoclonal anti-pan HLA class I antibody suitable for the immunostaining of formalin-fixed tissue and found a high rate (85%, 35 out of 41 cases) of HLA downregulation in breast cancer compared with other malignancies (20%–42%). Since HLA expression on tumor cells is important for the function of TILs, the downregulation of HLA might compromise the effective immune response in patients with breast cancer. Moreover, recent studies have reported increased IFN signaling in cancer cells and their association with a good response to anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast cancer. However, HLA expression, the level of IFN signaling activation, and their relationship in normal breast tissue and various subtypes of breast cancer have not been extensively studied."
2188,PMC9582481,INTRO,paragraph,"We previously demonstrated the differential expression of HLA-ABC in breast cancer. HLA-ABC protein expression was negatively correlated with estrogen receptor (ER) protein expression but was not significantly correlated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. HLA-ABC expression was higher in TNBC and hormone receptor (HR)−/HER2+ breast cancers than in HR+ breast cancers, was positively correlated with TILs, and was associated with better clinical outcomes in breast cancer patients. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data analysis, HLA-A gene expression was positively correlated with CD8B gene expression but was not significantly correlated with the total number of mutations. Instead, HLAs, CD3, and CD8 gene expression were positively correlated with IFN receptor genes and the IFN-inducible MxA gene. Additionally, MxA protein expression was higher in TNBC than in other types of breast cancer, was positively correlated with TIL levels, and was associated with better clinical outcomes. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that ER activity, IFN signaling, and MHC I expression regulate one another and influence TIL influx."

2192,PMC9582481,METHODS,paragraph,"This study used breast cancer cell lines obtained from ATCC, including ERα+ (MCF-7 and T47D) and ERα− (MDA-MB-231). The MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (cat No. 11995, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (cat No. 16000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (cat No. 15140, Invitrogen). The T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (Gibco, El Paso, TX) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. The cells were starved for 24 hours and treated with ICI (1 to 10 μM, fulvestrant, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), IFN-γ (100 units/mL, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or β-estradiol (1 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) in 2 mL of medium for an appropriate time.

2201,PMC9582481,METHODS,paragraph,"The histologic type was defined based on the 2019 World Health Organization classification criteria, and the histologic grade was assessed using the modified Bloom-Richardson classification. The hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides were histopathologically analyzed for TILs (defined as the percentage of the invasive carcinoma’s stroma that was infiltrated by lymphocytes in 10% increments; if less than 10% of the stroma was infiltrated by TILs, 1% or 5% criteria were used; all available full sections were evaluated), histological subtype and grade, tumor size, pT category, pN category, and lymphovascular invasion. The tumor response to neoadjuvant systemic therapy was evaluated based on the Miller-Payne grade (1, no change; 2, up to 30% reduction; 3, 30%–90% reduction; 4, more than 90% reduction; 5, no residual malignant cells). A pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer cells in the breast and lymph nodes."

ER and PR levels were regarded as positive if there was at least 1% positive tumor nuclei staining. Additionally, the Allred score, which is the sum of the intensity score (0–3) and the proportion score (0–5), was calculated for the ER and PR. HR+ tumors were defined as those determined to be ER-positive and/or PR-positive. HER2-overexpressing tumors were defined as those with scores of 3+ according to the immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by silver in situ hybridization. Ki-67 labeling index in the tumor cells was measured by eyeball estimation and dichotomized into < 20% and ≥ 20%."
2204,PMC9582481,METHODS,paragraph,"Among the 126 patients, 56 were available for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of both biopsies and resected specimens at the time of this study. Each resected tissue sample was arrayed in three 1-mm diameter cores to minimize tissue loss and overcome tumor heterogeneity. Full sections of biopsy tissues and tissue microarray sections of the resected tissues were stained with an automatic immunohistochemical staining device (Benchmark XT, Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ). The HLA-ABC staining was semi-quantitatively evaluated as the H-score, which is the product of the actual percentage of positive-stained cells and the intensity score (0–3); the H-score can range from 0–300. We then categorized HLA-ABC expression in tumor cells as one of two levels (negative, H-score < 50; positive, H-score ≥ 50)."

The baseline HLA-ABC protein expression was higher in the MDA-MB-231 cell line than in the MCF-7 and T47D cell lines (Fig. 1A). Next, we treated the MCF-7 cells with 1 to 10 μM ICI, which is an ER downregulator, for 24 or 48 hours. The ER protein expression decreased and HLA-ABC increased with ICI treatment under all conditions (Fig. 1B).

2216,PMC9582481,RESULTS,paragraph,"The clinicopathologic characteristics of the 126 patients who randomly received chemotherapy (adriamycin and cyclophosphamide) or estrogen modulator treatment (tamoxifen and goserelin) as their neoadjuvant systemic therapy and following surgical resection were analyzed (Table 1). Before the neoadjuvant therapy, there were no differences between the two groups in patient age, cT and cN categories, ER Allred score, Ki-67 labeling index, and TIL levels in biopsy specimens. After neoadjuvant therapy, no significant difference was observed in the pCR ratio (p=0.058). However, the chemotherapy group showed significantly lower ypT and ypN categories (p < 0.001 and p=0.016, respectively) and a more reduced tumor burden according to the Miller-Payne grade (p < 0.001). The estrogen modulator group showed more frequent lymphovascular invasion (p=0.046), a lower ER Allred score (p=0.027), higher Ki-67 labeling index (p=0.004) and higher TIL levels (p < 0.001) in resected specimens than the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (Figs. 4, 5)."
2217,PMC9582481,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we evaluated HLA-ABC expression in both the biopsy and resection tissues of 56 patients by immunohistochemistry (Table 1). Before neoadjuvant therapy, the HLA-ABC positivity in tumor cells did not differ significantly between the two groups (p=0.243). After neoadjuvant systemic therapy, however, the estrogen modulator group showed higher HLA-ABC positivity than the chemotherapy group (p=0.038)."
2218,PMC9582481,RESULTS,paragraph,"The overall survival and recurrence-free survival between the two groups did not differ significantly (p=0.396 and p=0.758, respectively) (S3 Fig.)."
2219,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,title_1,Discussion
2220,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Recently, the significance of TILs, particularly that of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, in breast cancer has been revealed. Higher TIL level is known to be associated with longer patient survival and better response to chemotherapy. Higher TIL level also correlates with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which may predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab recently have been approved in TNBC with PD-L1 expression by FDA. However, HR+ breast cancers are still considered to be immunologically cold, and it is not yet hopeful whether immunotherapy can be effective in patients with those cancers."
2221,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The expression of MHC I proteins on the tumor cell surface is essential for CD8+ T cells to act, and several reports have documented the positive relationship between TIL levels and MHC I expression. We previously reported that TILs were more abundant in tumors with a stronger expression of HLA-ABC. We also reported that the HLA-ABC expression of the tumor cells was positively correlated with TIL levels in consecutive series of primary breast cancers and TNBC cohorts. Although some may think that high HLA-ABC expression is due to a high mutation rate and more immunogenic mutations, we previously revealed that the total number of mutations was not associated with HLA-A expression in the tumor, and Spranger et al. also reported that the density of nonsynonymous somatic mutations is not significantly associated with T cell related gene expression."
2222,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Instead, some evidence has indicated that MHC I expression is related to ER expression and IFN signaling. In our previous study, HLA-ABC expression was negatively associated with ER expression in a consecutive breast cancer cohort and normal breast tissue, and HLA mRNA expression was positively correlated with IFN-associated gene expression in a TCGA and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data analysis. We also reported that the high expression of IFN-mediator MxA in the tumor cells was positively associated with TIL levels, CD8+ cell number, and stronger HLA-ABC expression and was an independent prognostic factor for better disease-free survival in breast cancer. Although one article has reported that ERα signaling modulates IFN-γ inducible MHC II expression through class II transactivator in breast cancer cells, the mechanism of the relationship between HLA-ABC expression, ER activity, and IFN signaling in breast cancers has never been reported."
2223,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In the current study, we revealed that the expressions of HLA-ABC protein and HLA-A mRNA in breast cancer cells are negatively affected by ER signaling in vitro. We insist that this is a novel and important finding in addition to previously known tumor-intrinsic oncogenic pathways that have been suggested to be associated with the reduction of immune reactions, such as the WNT/β-catenin pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway, MYC upregulation, and CDK4/6 activation. The baseline HLA-ABC protein expression was higher in ER-negative cells than in ER-positive cells, and HLA-ABC protein expression was increased after ICI treatment and decreased after ER overexpression. HLA-A mRNA expression was also increased after ESR1 shRNA transfection. We also revealed a positive association between HLA-ABC and IFN signaling and a negative association between ER and IFN signaling. Breast cancer cells showed increased HLA-ABC protein expression after IFN treatment and increased MxA mRNA expression after ESR1 shRNA transfection. This is the first study that analyzed the relationship between HLA-ABC expression, ER activity, and IFN signaling in breast cancer in vitro."
2224,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We also analyzed the breast cancer tissues of patients who received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy or estrogen modulator therapy. We revealed that the HLA-ABC expression in breast cancer cells increased and ER expression decreased after estrogen modulator treatment compared with chemotherapy. Estrogen modulator treatment negatively regulate ER signaling in breast cancer. By combining the results of the in vitro experiments, our data suggested that ER signaling was downregulated by estrogen modulator treatment, and this caused the increase of HLA-ABC expression in tumor cells. We also analyzed the TIL levels in biopsies and resection tissues from the two groups. TIL levels were significantly decreased in resected tissue after neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with biopsy tissue, which is concordant with a previous publication. Although the HLA-ABC expression in tumor cells was increased in the estrogen modulator treatment group, we did not identify a significant change in TIL levels in this group. This is possibly due to the insufficient duration of neoadjuvant estrogen modulator therapy. Further studies with a longer duration of neoadjuvant treatment are necessary. However, estrogen modulator therapy group still showed significantly higher TIL level in resected tissue than chemotherapy group. Park et al. reported that immune-stimulation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with pCR in breast cancer. Therefore, we suggest that higher HLA-ABC expression and TIL level in estrogen modulator therapy group may have a positive effect on prognosis of patients."
2225,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"We found that Ki-67 labeling index was decreased both after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and after neoadjuvant estrogen modulator treatment, but chemotherapy group showed significantly lower Ki-67 labeling index than estrogen modular treatment group in resected tumor tissue. This might be explained by the fact that conventional chemotherapeutic agents are generally toxic to proliferative cells. Considering that chemotherapy group showed remarkable decrease of Ki-67 labeling index but did not show significant change of HLA-ABC expression, we suggest that increase of HLA-ABC expression in estrogen modulator group is rather associated with downregulation of ER signaling than decreased proliferation activity."
2226,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"This study has several limitations. First, our data do not include in vitro results with estrogen treatment, the key molecule in ER signaling, or with tamoxifen treatment, an important selective ER modulator drug. Second, molecular mechanisms and mediators on how HLA-ABC expression and IFN signaling are regulated by ER signaling must be identified. Therefore, further experiments are necessary to more precisely define these molecular mechanisms. We suggest that more significant results might be obtained by future studies with more patient samples and a longer follow-up duration."
2227,PMC9582481,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In conclusion, this study demonstrated that MHC I expression and TIL levels were affected by ER pathway modulation and IFN treatment. Therefore, we suggest that downregulation of ER signaling might induce immune reaction in HR+ breast cancer. Further studies elucidating the mechanism of MHC I regulation could suggest a way to boost TIL influx in cancer and increase the efficacy of immunotherapy in treatment of HR+ breast cancer patients."

2255,PMC9739977,TITLE,front,Pharmacological Actions of 5-Hydroxyindolin-2 on Modulation of Platelet Functions and Thrombus Formation via Thromboxane A2 Inhibition and cAMP Production
2256,PMC9739977,ABSTRACT,abstract,"Platelets play a very significant role in hemostasis while simultaneously posing a risk for the development of various cardiovascular diseases. Platelet-mediated issues can occur in blood vessels and trigger various medical problems. Therefore, controlling platelet function is important in the prevention of thrombosis. In this regard, we need to find compounds that provide potent antiplatelet activity with minimum side effects. Therefore, we examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one isolated from Protaetia brevitarsis larvae having antiplatelet properties and investigated different pathways that mediate the antiplatelet activity. We examined the effect of 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) on the regulation of phosphoproteins, thromboxane A2 generation, and integrin αIIbβ3 action. Our data showed that human platelet aggregation was inhibited by 5-HI (75, 100, 150, 200 μM) without cytotoxicity, and it suppressed intracellular Ca2+ concentration through the regulation of inositol 1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor I (Ser1756) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Moreover, collagen-elevated thromboxane A2 production and αIIbβ3 action were inhibited by 5-HI through the regulation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt (protein kinase B). Therefore, we suggested that 5-HI could be a potential substance for the prevention of thrombosis-mediated thrombosis."
2257,PMC9739977,INTRO,title_1,1. Introduction
2258,PMC9739977,INTRO,paragraph,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which affects the heart and blood vessels, is the leading cause of death worldwide. CVD includes various diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, and stroke. Among the 18.6 million CVD deaths worldwide in 2019, 58% occurred in Asia. The Korean Society of Cardiology has recently published the Korea Heart Disease Fact Sheet 2020 and showed that CVD mortality has increased during the last decade in Korea. In addition, many studies are being conducted in Korea to investigate the relationship between cardiovascular disease and other diseases and various lifestyles. Among several risk factors of CVD, platelet mediated thrombosis is one of the most important factors, and various antiplatelet drugs are used to improve cardiovascular disease. Under normal circulatory conditions, platelets can play a vital role in maintaining hemostasis; however, aberrant platelet activation may cause thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Platelet aggregation in the blood vessels is central to the development of thrombosis; thus, the regulation of the platelet is important in preventing cardiovascular issues. Therefore, current antithrombosis therapies target platelet inhibition pathways. Collagen from damaged blood vessel activates platelets hydrolyze membrane phospholipids to inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3), and IP3 is liberated into the cytoplasm. [Ca2+]i mobilization from endoplasmic reticulum is controlled by IP3 receptor type I (IP3RI) on the surface of endoplasmic reticulum. At the same time, depletion of the [Ca2+]i level causes Ca2+ influx, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) regulates the influx. Elevated [Ca2+]i level facilitates granule release, and activated platelets produce thromboxane A2 (TXA2), leading to thrombus formation. These actions finally activate glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (αIIb/β3) after signal transduction processes, and αIIb/β3 leads to the formation of platelet meshes at the site of damage to blood vessels."
2259,PMC9739977,INTRO,paragraph,"Insects have been considered as drug resources, and many insects are being used in Oriental medicine. Among the various insect resources, Protaetia brevitarsis larvae is considered to be an important source of medicinal substance. Recently, the Protaetia brevitarsis larvae have also been approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety as a food resource in Korea. In order to verify the effect of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae, research on the component analysis has been conducted and alkaloid components were discovered. Among the alkaloids were 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) and (1R,3S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-b-carboline-3-carboxylic acid inhibited in vitro U46619-, and collagen-stimulated human platelet aggregation, coagulation activity, and bleeding time. However, the detailed inhibitory mechanism has not been studied. Therefore, we used 5-HI to evaluate the effect on the three activation mechanisms of platelets and to determine what works by inhibiting them. In this study, we examined whether 5-HI inhibits [Ca2+]i level, thromboxane A2 generation, and αIIb/β3-induced thrombus formation through the associated signaling molecules."

2261,PMC9739977,RESULTS,title_2,"2.1. 5-HI Blocks Platelet Activity, Cytotoxicity, and Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50)"
2262,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"To evaluate the antiplatelet activity of 5-HI (Figure 1A), various agonists were used for platelet aggregation. Collagen (2.5 μg/mL)-, thrombin (0.05 U/mL)-, and U46619 (200 nM)-activated platelets formed maximal aggregation. However, 5-HI inhibited all agonists-induced platelet aggregation (Figure 1B–D), and among them, collagen-induced aggregation was the most strongly inhibited. The 5-HI treated platelets showed no cytotoxicity (Figure 1E), and IC50 was 112.4 (Figure 1F)."
2263,PMC9739977,RESULTS,title_2,"2.2. 5-HI Blocks [Ca2+]i Levels, IP3RI-, ERK-Phosphorylation, and Granule Release"
2264,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, intracellular calcium concentration and calcium-associated signaling molecules were evaluated. Collagen-induced intracellular calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) were elevated to 582.5 ± 8.2 nM, but 5-HI treated [Ca2+]i mobilization was strongly inhibited (Figure 2A). It is well-known that cAMP/cGMP-dependent kinases phosphorylate IP3RI and its phosphorylation lead to the inhibition of [Ca2+]i mobilization. Therefore, we investigated whether 5-HI can influence IP3RI phosphorylation, and we confirmed that 5-HI showed strong IP3RI phosphorylation (Figure 2B). Another pathway is Ca2+ influx, which also increases the [Ca2+]i level. Thus, we evaluated whether 5-HI can affect thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx via ERK phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 2C,D, thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ influx was suppressed by 5-HI through ERK phosphorylation."
2265,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"Elevated [Ca2+]i concentration can facilitate the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and pleckstrin to trigger granule release. Therefore, we evaluated serotonin and ATP release from δ-granule. As shown in Figure 2E,F, 5-HI inhibited collagen-stimulated serotonin and ATP release dose-dependently."

2267,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"The synthesis of prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid is promoted through cyclooxygenase-1, and prostaglandin H2 is changed into TXA2. The TXA2 is a positive feedback mediator produced following platelet activation and acts as an agonist through Gq-coupled TXA2 receptor. As shown in Figure 3A, collagen stimulation leads the TXA2 generation, but the production is inhibited by 5-HI. Next, we investigated TXA2-related signaling molecules such as cPLA2 and p38MAPK. As shown in Figure 3B,C, collagen-elevated cPLA2 and p38MAPK phosphorylation were inhibited by 5-HI."
2268,PMC9739977,RESULTS,title_2,"2.4. 5-HI Blocks Fibronectin Adhesion, Fibrinogen Binding, VASP, PI3K, and Akt Phosphoryation"
2269,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"αIIb/β3 is the essential tool of platelet adhesion, binding, and spreading and causes platelet–platelet interaction and thrombus formation. The αIIb/β3 can bind to various adhesion proteins such as fibronectin and fibrinogen; thus, we examined whether 5-HI-treated platelets can influence fibronectin adhesion. As shown in Figure 4A, the adhesion between platelets and fibronectin was inhibited by 5-HI. Next, we evaluated fibrinogen-binding action. Collagen induced the binding rate, which was 90.2 ± 2.5% (Figure 4Bb). However, 5-HI significantly decreased fibrinogen-binding action to αIIb/β3 (Figure 4Bc–f,C). Next, we investigated signaling molecules such as PI3K, Akt, and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) connected with αIIb/β3. PI3K and Akt are mediators in platelets, leading to platelet shape change and αIIb/β3 activation. The interaction between agonists and platelets facilitate class I PI3Ks, leading to the phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate accumulation. Then, Akt binds to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 triphosphate. At the same time, VASP regulates actin for αIIb/β3 activation, but its phosphorylation inhibits actin elongation. Our data showed that 5-HI significantly downregulated PI3K/Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4D,E) and upregulated VASP phosphorylation at Ser157 (Figure 4F)."

2271,PMC9739977,RESULTS,paragraph,"Next, we investigated cAMP and cGMP concentration in human platelets. Our result showed that 5-HI significantly increased cAMP levels (Figure 5A) but did not influence the cGMP level. Next, we investigated whether 5-HI affects fibrin clot retraction. As shown in Figure 5B, 5-HI effectively delayed clot formation, with inhibitory degrees of 60.6%, 50.8%, 40.5%, and 28.3%, respectively (Figure 5B,C). Y27632 was used as a positive control."
2272,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,title_1,3. Discussion
2273,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Globally, cardiovascular diseases are considered among the leading causes of death. Thrombosis, a representative symptom of cardiovascular disease, is caused by an abnormal increase in thrombosis due to coagulation factors and platelet activation, which interferes with normal blood flow. Antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, and thrombolytic drugs are currently utilized for the prevention of thrombotic diseases. However, aspirin, an antiplatelet agent, has been reported to cause side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration. Therefore, it is necessary to find new potential substances without side effects, and the candidate substances should be evaluated for their antiplatelet effect, anticoagulation effect, and thrombolytic activity. The current study of insects has been focused mainly on the value of edible insects as a new alternative resource for bioactive molecules. Protaetia brevitarsis larvae have traditionally been used in alternative medicine to cure toxic epilepsy, thrush, and tetanus. Regarding the anticoagulant action, it has been reported that administration of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae ethanol extract showed antithrombotic efficacy in the rat, and insect-derived alkaloids prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT). In addition, insect-derived alkaloids showed antiplatelet effects, and among them, we focused on 5-hydroxyindolin-2-one (5-HI) and conducted a study to identify the exact inhibitory mechanism."
2274,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,paragraph,"The use of 5-HI suppressed various agonists-stimulated human platelet aggregation (Figure 1B–D) without cytotoxicity (Figure 2E). Next, we confirmed that 5-HI suppressed [Ca2+]i levels. It is well-known that [Ca2+]i levels are regulated by Ca2+ mobilization and Ca2+ influx, and the IP3RI and ERK phosphorylation is key for regulatory signaling molecules. Thus, we investigated whether 5-HI inhibited [Ca2+]i levels through the phosphorylation of IP3RI and dephosphorylation of ERK. Our data showed that 5-HI strongly suppressed [Ca2+]i levels through the phosphorylation of IP3RI and dephosphorylation of ERK (Figure 2A–D). Next, we examined whether 5-HI affects δ-granules release. Our data showed that collagen-stimulated serotonin and ATP secretion was inhibited by 5-HI (Figure 2E,F). Next, we determined that 5-HI inhibited TXA2 release (Figure 3A). Because TXA2 acts as a strong agonist, we focused on the TXA2 production and associated signaling molecules, such as cPLA2 and p38MAPK. We confirmed that 5-HI suppressed TXA2 production through the dephosphorylation of p38MAPK and cPLA2 (Figure 3B,C)."
2275,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Next, we investigated αIIb/β3 activation, leading platelet–platelet interaction. Various signaling events facilitate integrin activation, leading to the structural change of αIIb/β3. Activated platelets interact with other platelets via αIIb/β3, and as a result, another signaling mechanism begins inside the platelets. This signaling action is called the outside-in signaling pathway. Regarding the activation of αIIb/β3, PI3K/Akt and VASP are the crucial mediators. Therefore, we investigated whether 5-HI suppresses αIIb/β3 action by the dephosphorylation of PI3K/Akt and phosphorylation of VASP (Ser157). The use of 5-HI suppressed αIIb/β3 affinity (Figure 4A–C), decreased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation (Figure 4D,E), and increased VASP phosphorylation (Ser157) (Figure 4F). The cAMP and cGMP act as negative feedback molecules within the platelet. The cAMP and cGMP are generated by adenylate and guanylate cyclase for antiplatelet function and are decomposed by phosphodiesterases. These molecules can elevate the phosphorylation of VASP (Ser157, Ser239) and IP3RI (Ser1756). In our study, 5-HI increased only the cAMP level (Figure 5A), and these changes can block the αIIb/β3 action. Next, we investigated whether 5-HI can affect αIIb/β3-mediated fibrin clot retraction. As shown in Figure 5B,C, 5-HI strongly inhibited the clot retraction. Our study had some limitations: 5-HI increased the cAMP level in human platelets, and the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is thought to be due to increased cAMP. However, 5-HI also affected the phosphorylation of p38MAPK and cPLA2; this phosphorylation is not related to the increase in cAMP. Therefore, we could not clearly determine whether the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is due to the increase in cAMP or if it can regulate all proteins in turn. Additionally, all of our studies were conducted in vitro. Although the antiplatelet effect of 5-HI is strong, it is difficult to predict the effect in the human body. The in vivo antiplatelet effect of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae ethanol extract has not been studied, and the in vivo bioactivity effect of 5-HI should also be evaluated in the future. However, 5-HI showed an effect in an in vivo bleeding test and delayed thrombus in an ex vivo coagulation test. Therefore, based on the results, we suggest that 5-HI has the potential to inhibit thrombosis-mediated cardiovascular disease. Various laboratory data have shown that medicinal plants may have therapeutic potential in cardiovascular disease, and it has been identified that Ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and Ganoderma lucidum have potential effects on cardiovascular disease in vitro and in vivo. A randomized clinical trial was conducted on the use of Ginseng, Ginkgo biloba, and Ganoderma lucidum for the treatment of cardiovascular disease, but the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants in cardiovascular disease have not been clinically observed. However, coadministration of traditional cardiovascular disease drugs and natural products has shown potential for the inhibition of cardiovascular disease, and several clinical trials in cardiovascular disease are still ongoing. In our previous study, ginsenosides showed strong antiplatelet effects, and their inhibitory concentrations were similar to those of 5-HI. Therefore, 5-HI also has the potential for clinical application in patients with cardiovascular disease."
2276,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Beyond a crucial task in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelets are an important regulator of inflammatory reaction, immune response, atherosclerosis, and cancer metastasis. This is achieved by the expression of adhesive molecules and receptors on the platelet surface and by the release of secretory products including inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Interactions between platelets and endothelial cells at atherosclerotic-prone sites can enhance the recruitment of leukocyte through the release of cytokines, chemokines, and proinflammatory molecules, and the interaction between platelets, endothelial cells, and leukocytes can promote a localized inflammatory response that can accelerate the early formation of atherosclerotic lesions. In the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, endothelial damage allows precipitation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to the subendothelial layer, and LDL are modified into oxidized LDL (ox-LDL). Platelets have receptors for ox-LDL, which can cause aggregation and form clots."
2277,PMC9739977,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Looking at various studies related to the action of platelets, it has been reported that platelet mitochondrial reactive oxygen species contributes to age-related thrombosis, and endogenous superoxide dismutase 2 protects from platelet-dependent thrombin generation and thrombosis during aging. Another report showed that platelets express pathogen-recognition molecules such as toll-like receptors and FcgRIIa receptor. Therefore, platelets can become activated by an interaction with the pathogen, and it has also been reported that cancer cells can interact with platelets to cause platelet aggregation and tumor metastasis. These various results show that platelets participate in various mechanisms and diseases. Therefore, the platelet aggregation reaction inhibited by 5-HI has a prospective potential in various clinical actions and diseases. We hope that 5-HI will be used in various research fields and be developed as a new natural drug."

2319,PMC9771960,TITLE,front,Effects of ethanol on GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptor-ion channel gating kinetics
2320,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Background
2321,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major molecular target of alcohol action in the central nervous system, yet many aspects of the manner in which alcohol modulates the activity of this ion channel remain unclear. We and others have shown that ethanol inhibition of NMDAR involves alterations in gating, especially reduction of mean open time. A full description of ethanol’s effects on NMDAR kinetics, however, including fitting to a kinetic model, has not been reported."
2322,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Methods
2323,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract,"To determine ethanol’s effects on NMDAR kinetics, we used steady-state single-channel recording in outside-out patches from HEK-293 cells transfected with recombinant GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDAR subunits. Very low glutamate concentrations were used in order to isolate individual activations of the receptor."
2324,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Results
2325,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract,"In both subunit types, ethanol, at approximate whole-cell IC50 values (156 mM, GluN2A; 150 mM, GluN2B), reduced open probability (Po) by approximately 50%, and decreased mean open time without changing frequency of opening. Open and shut time distributions exhibited two and five components, respectively; ethanol selectively decreased the time constant and relative proportion of the longer open time component. In the GluN2A subunit, ethanol increased the time constants of all but the longest shut time components, whereas in the GluN2B subunit, shut times were unchanged by ethanol. Fitting of bursts of openings (representing individual activations of the receptor) to the gating portion of a kinetic model revealed that ethanol altered two rates: the rate associated with activation of the GluN2A or GluN2B subunit, and the rate associated with closing of the longer of the two open states."
2326,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract_title_1,Conclusions
2327,PMC9771960,ABSTRACT,abstract,"These results demonstrate that ethanol selectively alters individual kinetic rates, and thus appears to selectively affect distinct conformational transitions involved in NMDAR gating."
2328,PMC9771960,INTRO,title_1,Introduction
2329,PMC9771960,INTRO,paragraph,"Alcohol use disorders present as alterations in behavior, including impairment of motor function, cognition and judgment, and disrupted social interactions during intoxication, but these complex behaviors ultimately arise from changes in synaptic transmission in the brain, due to ethanol-induced alterations in physiological processes including neurotransmitter release, kinase and phosphatase activity, and neuronal ion channel function. A large body of evidence supports an important role for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-ion channel in mediating alcohol action in the brain, both in acute intoxication, as well as in phenomena including alcohol craving, tolerance, dependence, withdrawal, and relapse. Although alcohol can modulate NMDA receptor sensitivity and signaling via multiple mechanisms, its direct action on NMDA receptors involves altering ion channel gating via an interaction with specific modulatory sites."
2330,PMC9771960,INTRO,paragraph,"Previous studies have shown that ethanol inhibits NMDA receptor gating by decreasing both mean open time and frequency of opening, without appreciably changing closed times. These studies established that ethanol inhibition involves modulation of gating, but were performed prior to the development of accurate models of ion channel gating, so the precise effects of ethanol on the transitions among the different kinetic states that constitute NMDAR gating behavior have not been determined. In addition, the studies of and were performed in native CNS neurons in culture. While the conditions used in these studies should closely approximate NMDA receptor modulation by ethanol in vivo, the subunit composition of the receptors tested in these studies is unknown, and most likely was a varying mixture of GluN1/GluN2A, GluN1/GluN2B, and GluN1/GluN2A/GluN2B heterotrimeric NMDA receptors. In the present study, we used single-channel recording in recombinant GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B subunit-containing NMDA receptors expressed in the HEK-293 cell line. Using low agonist concentrations to allow separation of groups of opening events into bursts representing individual activations of the receptor, we fit the data to the gating portion of a cyclic model to determine the kinetic effects of ethanol on NMDA receptor gating. Under these conditions, the effect of ethanol was primarily attributable to alteration of two specific ion channel gating rate constants in the kinetic model in both subunit types."

2335,PMC9771960,METHODS,paragraph,"Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured as previously described. Cells were allowed to grow to 75 – 90% confluence before transient transfection with plasmids containing rat GluN1–1a (pRC) and GluN2A (pcDNA1) or GluN2B (pDP3) subunits and green fluorescent protein (Addgene) at a ratio of 2:2:1 using a calcium phosphate transfection kit or Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen ThermoFisher). During and after the transfection, 200 μM D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) and either 100 μM ketamine or 100 μM memantine were added to the culture media to protect cells from glutamate excitotoxicity. Cells were used in experiments 18 to 72 hr after transfection."
2336,PMC9771960,METHODS,title_2,Electrophysiological recording.
2337,PMC9771960,METHODS,paragraph,"Patch-clamp recording was performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 1D or Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) amplifier. Patch-pipets were coated with R6101 elastomer (Dow-Corning), and had tip resistances of 8 – 15 MΩ following heat polishing. Outside-out patches were voltage-clamped at −50 mV and superfused in Mg2+-free external recording solution containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 μM EDTA, 10 glucose, and 10 sucrose. Solution pH was adjusted to 7.4 by adding a calculated ratio of HEPES free acid to HEPES sodium salt (Buffer Calculator, available at https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/pfg/Tools/BuffferCalc/Buffer.html). Ultrapure salts and chemicals were used to minimize contamination by other cations. The intracellular recording solution contained (in mM) 140 CsCl, 2 Mg4ATP, 10 BAPTA, and 10 HEPES; pH was adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. Solutions of agonists and ethanol were prepared fresh daily in extracellular solution and applied to cells using a stepper motor-driven rapid solution exchange apparatus (Fast-step, Warner Instrument Co.) and 600 μm id square glass tubing. The ethanol concentrations used were 156 mM (GluN2A) and 150 mM (GluN2B), which we have found in preliminary experiments and previous results using whole-cell patch-clamp recording to be the approximate IC50 values; we have previously reported similar values, although other laboratories have reported greater differences in sensitivity between the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits. Recordings alternated between control and ethanol exposure at one or two minute intervals in order to minimize the influence of any slow changes in ion channel activity. Low concentrations of glutamate in the presence of a saturating concentration of glycine were used to obtain widely separated individual receptor activations. Each patch was exposed to an initial concentration of 100 nM glutamate; in some cases a concentration of 1 μM glutamate was used in patches exhibiting very low levels of activity."
2338,PMC9771960,METHODS,title_2,Data Analysis.
2339,PMC9771960,METHODS,paragraph,"Data from single-channel recordings were acquired at 50 kHz, digitally filtered at 5 kHz (8-pole Bessel), and idealized using the segmentation K-means algorithm in the QUB software suite. Open and shut dwell time histograms were fitted with multiple exponential components using Channelab (Synaptosoft) after imposing a 50–100 μs dead time, and mean open times were obtained from the proportionally-weighted averages of the individual components. Frequency of opening was calculated by dividing the number of openings by the recording time. Data were obtained from 7 patches for each subunit combination. Patches used for each subunit combination had one to three levels of opening, and were obtained on multiple experimental days over the course of several weeks. Burst analysis was performed in steady-state single-channel records by using values of the critical time interval (τcrit) from shut time histograms that minimized the total number of misclassified events. Bursts with more than one level of opening were excluded from analysis. The values for τcrit were calculated to be between the third and fourth components of the shut time in GluN2A and between the fourth and fifth components of the shut time in GluN2B in order to isolate burst events corresponding to individual receptor activations."

2345,PMC9771960,RESULTS,title_2,Effect of Ethanol on NMDA Receptor Single-Channel Conductance.
2346,PMC9771960,RESULTS,paragraph,"In outside-out patches from cells expressing GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptor subunits, low concentrations of glutamate (0.1 – 1 μM) in the presence of a saturating concentration of glycine (50 μM) elicited a low level of NMDA receptor activity, with groups of openings widely separated by long closings (Fig. 1.). This pattern of activity was observed in both the absence and the presence of ethanol (156 mM, GluN2A; 150 mM, GluN2B). Ethanol did not alter the single-channel chord conductance determined from all-points histograms (Fig. 2; GluN2A: 54.6 ± 1.63 vs. 56.7 ± 2.59 pS in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 54.2 ± 1.23 vs. 52.5 ± 1.75 pS in the absence and presence of ethanol, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches), and did not produce any evident alteration in the appearance of the single-channel records, such as flickering block (Fig 3A,C; Fig 4 A, C)."

2348,PMC9771960,RESULTS,paragraph,"Open time distributions for glutamate-activated current in GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors could be adequately fitted by two components (GluN2A: 62.6 ± 6.24 μs and 4.01 ± 0.441 ms; GluN2B: 130 ± 16.9 μs and 5.39 ± 0.234 ms) with similar proportions of openings (GluN2A: 48.3 ± 2.38 % and 51.8 ± 2.39 %, and GluN2B: 49.7 ± 3.81 % and 50.3 ± 3.81 % for the fast and slow components, respectively, Fig. 3B, 4B). The mean open times were 3.21 ± 0.341 ms (GluN2A) and 3.51 ± 0.216 ms (GluN2B). In the presence of ethanol mean open time was decreased in GluN2A by 33% to 2.17 ± 0.243 ms (Fig 3D; P < 0.001, paired t-test, N = 7 patches), and in GluN2B by 42% to 2.05 ± 0.376 ms (Fig 4D; P < 0.01, paired t-test, N = 7 patches). Open time distributions in the presence of ethanol were also well fitted by two components; the time constant of the fast component was not significantly changed compared to the control condition (GluN2A: 50.3 ± 3.97 μs; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 138 ± 42.1 μs; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches), but that of the slow component was significantly decreased (GluN2A: 3.07 ± 0.345 ms; paired t-test, P < 0.001, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 3.59 ± 0.269 ms; paired t-test, P < 0.01, N = 7 patches). In the GluN2A subunit, but not the GluN2B subunit, the areas of both components were significantly changed, such that there were relatively more fast openings in the presence of ethanol (62.0 ± 4.11 % and 38.0 ± 4.12 % for the fast and slow components, respectively; paired t-test, P < 0.05, N = 7 patches). In contrast, overall frequency of opening was not changed by ethanol in either subunit type (GluN2A: 7.91 ± 1.96 vs. 7.34 ± 1.30 for control and ethanol-treated patches, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches; GluN2B: 15.8 ± 6.52 vs. 13.6 ± 5.99 for control and ethanol-treated patches, respectively; paired t-test, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches)."
2349,PMC9771960,RESULTS,title_2,Effects of Ethanol on Shut Times.
2350,PMC9771960,RESULTS,paragraph,"For both subunit types, shut time distributions for patches in the absence of ethanol could be fitted with five exponential components ranging from approximately 50 μs to 400 ms (Table 1 and Fig 4). Similar distributions were also obtained in the same patches exposed to ethanol. In contrast to its effects on open time, ethanol did not alter any of the shut time constants (repeated measures ANOVA, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches) or their relative areas (repeated measures ANOVA, P > 0.05, N = 7 patches). As would be expected from the observation above that ethanol did not produce flickering block, ethanol did not introduce any additional shut times."
2351,PMC9771960,RESULTS,title_2,Fitting of Burst Data to a Kinetic Model.
2352,PMC9771960,RESULTS,paragraph,"A distinct separation was evident in the shut time distributions between the third and fourth components in GluN2A subunit-containing receptors and between the fourth and fifth components in GluN2B subunit-containing receptors. In the GluN2A subunit, the shortest three shut times are considered to occur within an individual activation of the receptor-ion channel. Of the longest two shut times, one represents a long-lived desensitized state (within an activation), and one the agonist-unbound state (between activations). Although there is evidence from some studies that ethanol may influence NMDAR desensitization, the absence of a change in the closed time corresponding to the desensitized state in the presence of ethanol is consistent with a negligible effect under the conditions used in this study. In the GluN2B subunit, the longest two shut times are considered to differentiate individual activations of the receptor-ion channel. To determine the effects of ethanol on gating transitions in the fully-liganded, non-desensitized receptor, we grouped opening events into bursts that should correspond to individual activations of the receptor by choosing values of τcrit between the third and fourth (GluN2A) or fourth and fifth (GluN2B) shut time components (Fig 5, arrows). Values of τcrit determined for patches in the absence and presence of ethanol were 10.7 and 8.9 ms, respectively for GluN2A and 83.3 and 151 ms, respectively for GluN2B. We extracted bursts from the idealized data record such that closed times longer than the τcrit value were not included in the analysis. Maximal interval likelihood fitting of bursts to scheme 1 of, a cyclic model that does not incorporate agonist binding and unbinding steps or desensitized states (Fig. 6), yielded values for the rate constants that in general were similar to those previously determined (Table 2). In both GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, ethanol selectively altered two of the kinetic transitions: it decreased the rate constant for the slow forward rate, ks+, by 28.4 % (paired t-test, P < 0.0005) in GluN2A and by 30.2 % (paired t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2B, and increased the reverse rate between open states, o−, by 49.8 % (t-test, P < 0.001) in GluN2A and 31 % (t-test, P < 0.05) in GluN2B. The remaining kinetic values were not appreciably altered by ethanol (mean change: 8.0 percent; t-tests, P > 0.05). To test whether the two changed rate constants could account for the observed decreases in mean open time and open probability due to ethanol, we substituted these rates in the model and generated simulated current traces using the QUB program, leaving all other rates unchanged from their control values. Changing the slow forward rate, ks+, and the open state reverse rate, o−, to their values in the presence of ethanol accounted for 91% and 90% of the inhibitory effect of ethanol on open probability in the GluN2A and GluN2B subunits, respectively."

2354,PMC9771960,DISCUSS,paragraph,"In the present study, we used recombinant rat GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDAR to demonstrate that inhibition by ethanol at its approximate IC50 values (GluN2A: 156 mM; GluN2B: 150 mM in this study) involved a decrease in mean open time without appreciable changes in frequency of opening, single-channel conductance, or shut time distribution, and that the effect of ethanol was attributable to selective modulation of two specific ion channel gating rate constants in the kinetic model used."
2355,PMC9771960,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Following the initial demonstrations that ethanol inhibits NMDA receptor activity, a few studies used single-channel recording to examine the alterations in receptor kinetics responsible for the inhibitory effect. In the earliest such study, reported that ethanol (86.5 and 174 mM) decreased NMDAR mean open time in outside-out patches from rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons without altering single-channel conductance. These investigators observed a decrease in open probability of approximately 50%, but did not report values for opening frequency. subsequently showed that in outside-out patches from mouse cerebral cortical neurons, ethanol (200 mM) decreased both mean open time and frequency of opening without altering single-channel conductance or shut times, and without introducing fast flickering behavior. The reduction in mean open time was greater than that in frequency of opening, but both were required to account for the observed reduction in whole-cell current by ethanol. In the present study, at a concentration similar to those used previously, but in recombinant rat GluN1/GluN2A or GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors expressed in a cultured cell line rather than in native CNS neurons, we observed similar effects of ethanol: the main effect was to decrease mean open time of the ion channel without altering single channel conductance. There was also no difference in closed time distributions, including no introduction of very short closed times, or fast flickering behavior. Because either an increase in very short closed times or reduced single-channel conductance could indicate an open-channel block mechanism, the absence of either finding has been interpreted as evidence that ethanol does not act by occluding the ion channel. The observation that ethanol primarily shortens mean open time is consistent with a mechanism of inhibition involving an increase in the rate of ion channel closing."
2356,PMC9771960,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Previous studies have reported that magnesium ions, which normally block NMDA receptors at strongly negative potentials under physiological conditions, can enhance ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors, although this has not been observed in all studies. In the present study, experiments were performed in the absence of extracellular magnesium to avoid block at negative membrane potentials. It is thus possible that this resulted in a lesser degree of ethanol inhibition than would be observed at physiological concentrations of magnesium. In addition, because magnesium alters gating kinetics (Kampa et al., 2004), it is also possible that magnesium, if it had been present, could have altered the effects of ethanol on the kinetic model. Many early studies also demonstrated glycine modulation of ethanol inhibition of NMDA receptors and proposed glycine antagonism as a mechanism of inhibition; however, the binding of glycine or glutamate is not altered by ethanol, nor is ethanol inhibition competitive with respect to glycine or glutamate. In the present study we therefore excluded transitions involved in agonist or coagonist binding by fitting events occurring during bursts, which represent single activations of the ion channel, and are separated by one or two long shut times attributable to agonist dissociation and (in the GluN2A subunit) desensitization. Thus we attempted to model the effect of ethanol on gating of the fully-liganded, non-desensitized receptor. Fitting of events during bursts in the absence and presence of ethanol to a simple cyclic model using the maximum interval likelihood (MIL) function of the QUB program revealed that two rate constants in the gating section of the model were appreciably affected by ethanol in both GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B receptors: the slow forward rate, ks+, in the cyclic portion of the model was decreased, and the main open state reverse rate, o−, was increased. The slow forward rate, along with the slow reverse rate, ks−, has been attributed to conformational changes in the GluN2 subunit. Thus this result is consistent with ethanol acting via the GluN2 subunit, and the lack of effect of ethanol on the fast forward rate indicates that the corresponding transition in the GluN1 subunit is insensitive to ethanol, which could be due to structural differences between the subunit types underlying the much faster transitions in the GluN1 subunit. The main open state reverse rate affects the longer of the two open times, such that increasing this rate decreases the duration of the longer component. The longer open state accounts for the majority of charge transfer mediated by the NMDAR, so preferentially shortening it has a relative effect greater than would be caused by a similar change to the shorter component. Our simulations indicated that the two states that were measurably altered by ethanol accounted for the great majority of its inhibitory effect."
2357,PMC9771960,DISCUSS,paragraph,"Although ethanol can modulate the activity of NMDA receptors via multiple actions, such as by altering phosphorylation and interacting proteins, in this study we have chosen to focus on its direct action on the NMDA receptor-channel, which can be observed under conditions in which intracellular mechanisms of modulation are minimized or eliminated, and which occurs at intoxicating concentrations. A consideration in the present study is that interacting mechanisms present in CNS neurons may be absent in the expression system used. It should also be noted that the concentrations used in the present study are above the normal range for intoxication in humans (~20 – 50 mM), although even greater concentrations than those used here may be reached in highly-tolerant individuals. Concentrations at approximate IC50 values were used in the present study to ensure that changes in individual microscopic kinetic rates, which act in concert to determine NMDA receptor gating, would be detectable. Results of many studies from this and other laboratories showing sigmoidal ethanol concentration-response curves with slopes of approximately unity are consistent with the view that lower concentrations of ethanol would have qualitatively similar effects. Available evidence supports the view that the NMDA receptor is responsible for some of the effects of intoxicating ethanol concentrations in humans. We and others have identified clusters of adjacent residues in the third and fourth membrane-associated domains of the GluN1 and GluN2 subunits of the NMDA receptor that strongly regulate ethanol sensitivity, and which appear to form the sites by which ethanol inhibits the receptor under the conditions used in this study. While significant advances have been made in understanding the conformational changes that underlie ion channel gating, and available evidence is consistent with movements of the alcohol-sensitive side chains relative to each other during gating transitions, further studies will be required to determine how the ethanol molecule interacts with these domains to alter the kinetics of the conformational changes that are responsible for the rate constants that are regulated by ethanol."
